<br><br>

<p><b>Intro</b>
<p>In 2023, it's been the first year where I competed to JS13k while being unemployed. However, that didn't mean I had more spare time or energy to spend on my entry, as I'm quite busy on other projects, and my eyesight is becoming less and less good with time... So during the first 3 weeks of the jam, I only spent 1-2 hours per day working on my entry (a bit more if you count all the off-screen thinking and brainstorming), and in the last 4 days I put a bit more hours in (4-5 per day) in order to release on time and in the byte budget. In total it took about 75 hours. Here's how it went...

<br><br><p><b>Day 0 (August 13th)</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1691134696665632771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><b>13th century</b>, tough theme indeed! None of the vague ideas I had before starting the jam could fit in that theme or even include a little something about the 13th century. 
<p>So I started from scratch, by looking on Wikipedia what was invented and discovered in that epoch, to make this list:
<p><img src="images/js13k23/1.jpg"><br><br>
<p>You can note that many items of this list have bacome elements of my final game (cannon, clock, paper, astronomy...). Some others were considered for some of my puzzles but didn't get implemented (mirror, soap...).

<p>I scribbled some game ideas at the bottom of the page, the "escape game" is at the very end. I wish I had decided to start with that immediately...
<br><br>

<p><b>Days 1-2</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1691553715398820020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>

<p>I spent the first two days prototyping and thinking pretty thoroughly a "castles & cannons" game concept where you successively play the role of a king who builds his castle, and his successor who needs to tumble it down with cannon balls. Each king has a successor that is a few dozen meters away, and needs to build his own castle from the bricks he removed from the previous king's castle, while having to build his own castle on a more and more inconvenient ground (slope, hill, mointain, ice, water, etc). The game would end when you run out of bricks.
<p>The only problem is that besides the cannon firing, this was not fun at all, and I had to take the difficult decision to stop and restart from scratch with something else...
<br><br>
<p><b>Days 3-4</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1692244621240242619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>
<p>The decision to make a castle escape game was taken on day 3... though, once again, I had no idea if I'd be able to release an interesting game. But I decided to try my best anyway.
These two days were spent drawing a 16-room castle on paper and imagining all sorts of puzzles and interactions that could happen in it in no particular order.
<p>Here are some HD photos:
<p><img src="images/js13k23/2.jpg"><br><br>
<p><img src="images/js13k23/3.jpg"><br><br>
<p><img src="images/js13k23/4.jpg"><br><br>
<p>All the elements and ideas of the final game are here, minus some adjustments (rooms inversions) and some ideas I had to abandon to release on time (using mirrors to reflect light, use seed plus bathroom water plus time machine to grow a plant, or even a music room where you'd have to play some kind of Simon game to solve a puzzle). Fortunately, I think I made the good decisions, as the puzzles and events present in the final game are quite well balanced and sequenced.
<p>By the way, in order to find some inspiration, I watched gameplays of old, cheap, flash games which are all more or less copy-pasted from each other, such as <a href="https://gamaverse.com/kings-castle-escape-game/">King Castle Escape</a>, <a href="https://gamaverse.com/gold-castle-escape-game/">Gold Castle Escape</a>, <a href="https://gamaverse.com/princess-castle-escape-game/">Princess Castle Escape</a> and <a href="https://gamaverse.com/medieval-castle-escape-game/">Medieval Castle Escape</a>.
You'll find obvious similarities between these games and mine (shields, lock combinations, torches, broken drawbridge...), but I tried to do something as original as possible, even though all castle escape games tend to resemble each other a little, with all these grey bricks, towers, gates, windows, knights, etc... Welp, it is what it is! As long as we have some fun...
<br><br>
<p><b>Days 5-6</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1692903723410890810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>
<p>Let's start coding, finally! At this moment, my game scenario is far from complete, I still have no idea in which order the puzzles must be solved and the items must be used to beat the game, but it won't stop me from defrosting my CSS3D framework, trim all the methods I don't need (actually I just kept "plane" and "move", which take about 1.5kb minified and 0.8 zipped), and start implementing the first room of the game (the top of the left tower).
<p>Here already, 5 different technologies are used to render the scene (I never used so many together before): CSS3D (to make the brick tower cylindric), emoji (door, lock, bed, hole, frame, man and crown in the frame), CSS (for the backgrounds, dynamic brick lighting proportional to their depth, radial-gradient for the sun, filters to make everything a bit sepia, etc), custom SVGs (for the window, bars, staircase and frame hanger), and Canvas 2D (to draw the sunbeam passing through the window).
<p>The result convinced me, so I prepared the next steps: I built all the room layouts I'll need for my game, out of CSS3D (tower top, tower bottom, first floor under a tower, first floor not under a tower, ground floor... plus walls on the sides for the square rooms on the left or on the right of the building). The hardest part was probably not the one you'd imagine... what took me the most code and brainpower was to draw the half-bricks an quarter-bricks on each side of the rooms.
<p>I showed a snippet of my "brick code" on Slack for fun, and someone had it analyzed by chatGPT, which surprisingly, guessed exactly what were my intentions when I used <b>Math.random()</b> in the  brick's coordinates. It was a fun moment:
<p><img src="images/js13k23/6.png"><br><br>

<p>Another thing harder than it seems is to make holes (windows) inside the tower's wall. After a lot of head-scratching, I finally decided to draw a SVG with a sky blue background <b>#def</b> and render it in front of the wall. Looks exactly like a hole to me, without having to do any complex clipping technique!
<p>The 2D canvas is placed between the background (wall, window, door, bed, etc) and the foreground (the light bricks), and it really looks like the sunlight comes through the window, when in reality it's all fake.

The whole thing is also much flatter than it appears (seen from above):
<p><img src="images/js13k23/7.jpg"><br><br>

Finally, I counted the (CSS3D) divs in my scene and it's "only" 179... I've made many games with much more CSS3D complexity than that! But none with so many SVGs and Canvas 2D elements on top. Turns out, browsers seem support that pretty well!

My zip is still smaller than 2.5kb, good news so far! My goal is to have the whole castle fitting in under 8kb and use the rest for interactivity, puzzles, animations etc.

<br><br>
<p><b>Days 7-10</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1693667920189030426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1694410018966077654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>
<br><br>
<p>Those 4 days were exclusively spent filling and decorating my castle's rooms with emoji, custom svgs and sometimes just colored divs (boulders, chimney, books)...
<p>At the same time, in my mind, the scenario becomes clearer and clearer, so I often return to previous rooms to add or rearrange some items.
<p>I doubt a lot that the result will be fun, but at least it will be playable!
<p>Regarding the emoji: I had the chance to find appropriate emoji for most of my objects (telescope, shield, man, papyrus, wood, cheese, bowl of soup, crown, magic wand, dragon, hammer, chains, skeleton, chef, bat, spider web, mouse, cog, etc), but I also had the chance that the emoji webfont I picked (Twemoji.ttf, allowed by js13k's rules because it's a polyfill) contained a ladder that looked very much like a shelf, which allowed me to discard this boring SVG:
<p><img src="images/js13k23/8.jpg"><br><br>
<p>...and the building emoji, that looks a lot like a fireplace when you put a grey rectangle on top and some little fire emoji in front of it:
<p><img src="images/js13k23/10.jpg"><br><br>
<p>On the other hand, I was quite bummed to find that there were no emoji as basic as: a cannon, an anvil, a table, a haystack or hayball, a knight, a witch, a chest, a witch, big castle doors, etc... so I spent a lot of time (and bytes) drawing them myself, in svg, with my <a href="https://xem.github.io/miniSVGcreator/">MinSVGcreator tool</a>.
<p><img src="images/js13k23/9.jpg"><br><br>
<p>By chance, SVGs are small, text-based and very repetitive, so they zip extremely well: my 28 svgs take 7.7kb minified and about 1.8kb zipped.
<p><img src="images/js13k23/11.jpg"><br><br>

<p><b>Day 11</b>
<p>No code today! (I was occupied renovating my house and inviting friends)

<br><br>
<p><b>Days 12-13</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1695435647534747921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>

<p>I spent these two days completing and polishing all the rooms of my castle, and implemented the very first interactivity of the game: hover texts.
<p>Every object present on screen (except bricks, ground, ceiling, sky, mountain and light beams) can be hovered with the mouse when you play on a PC. 
<p>I had this idea since day 3, because I thought it would make my entry look more like a LucasArts point&click game, but also because I wanted to impress players by the verbosity of my game, even if it's only 13kb. 
<p>The best part is that it cost me virtually 0 extra bytes, because since the beginning, I gave all my items a CSS className equal to their name in english. So all I had to do (in the source code of the CSS3DFramework) was something like this in the plane creation method: <b>scene.innerHTML+=`&lt;div id="${t.id}"class="${t.css}"onmouseover="writeCaption('${t.css}')">`</b>

<p>Unfortunately, now that my items had hitboxes (for mouse hover, and later, clicks), I realized that their sizes were all wrong, especially the ones containing custom svgs. So I had to go through my 16 finished rooms and fix manually the width, height and thus, the position of absolutely everything, which caused a huge time loss...

<p>The good news is that I'm still very low in size, my zip is even smaller than I had hoped (5.07kb)!

<br><br>
<p><b>Days 14-15</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1696236475325575552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>

<p>I put myself in front of the computer and didn't quit it until all the hitboxes and positions were fixed, that was extremely boring, but it worked.
<p>Then I could finally start implementing clicks, and started with room transitions! Each open door and staircase has either a "up" button, a "down" button, or both (when in the middle of a tower), while the big square rooms also have left and right arrows, when applicable.
<p>It's a real pleasure to finally be able to visit my castle entirely!

<br><br>
<p><b>Days 16-19</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1696964164801954188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>

<p>I'm officially late! It's the middle of the month and I have zero gameplay yet... and so many things to do!
<p>But first thing first: I started with an inventory system, where we can store items gathered in the castle, then a system allowing to pick an item for an inventory and use it on an element in the room (ex: "use frame hanger on lock"). I also put in place all the architecture allowing special things to happen when objects are taken, dropped or used, and the hardest part: keep the state of each room in memory to be able to see it unchanged when you exit it and re-enter it later. In total, 41 global vars were used to store the game's state!
<p>Unfortunately again, I should have directly put these in a single JS object, to make localStorage persistence trivial. The idea of making the game progression saveable and loadable only arrived at the very end of the development and I had to fix each of these variables and the 562 places where they are used in the source code...
<p>To continue with mouse interactivity, I completed the first room of the game (it's playable from start to end, yay), and made the notes on the walls and books in the library readable!
<p>After implementing all the other collectable items, I doubled the inventory space, to 12 slots. There are more than 12 collectibles in the game, but you can never have all of them at once, so it's fine. 

<br><br>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1697699205672776120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>

<p>I'm progressibely making all my rooms playable, but also implement "puzzle rooms" (when the scene changes to show a puzzle to solve, such as the sword-in-rock mini-game or the lock combinations).
<p>Even after writing some book of my library, I'm glad to see that the zip size is still not exploding (7.65kb).

<br><br>
<p><b>Days 20-21</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1698335155532800471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>

<p>Already day 20, time to make a TODO list and see how much work is left... and unfortunately it's a lot: 20 item interactions to implement, as well as 4 animations, 5 puzzles, 2 big svgs, all the music and sound effects, testing, golfing and think of some decentralized bonuses.

<p>Days 20 and 21 added 1kb to the zip (puzzle rooms tend to use a lot of code).

<br><br>
<p><b>Days 22-23</b>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/1699107061395534270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"></a></blockquote>

<p>During these two days, I added another kibibyte to my zip with just one feature, certainly the most complex of the game: the witch's time wheel. This one took a lot of time both for brainstorming, and for implementing it.
<p>Fortunately, with CSS transitions, all the rotations and color changes didn't require a lot of effort. The hardest part was to set and update the right variables when the wheel turns, in order to determine the current day, hour, wheel angle, wheel angle modulo 360, and consequently, the phase of the moon, the haystack-burning setup, and of course, the presence of 0, 1 or 2 prisoners in the right tower if it's not full moon, the presence of the werewolf if it's full moon, and its absence when it's dead.
<p>After letting people test my game, I realized that no one had the idea to get back in time to talk to the second prisoner before he dies, or to get back even further to see the cell empty, even though it's hinted by the dialogs... bummer! But I'm glad I still implemented all  these situations for completion's sake. Also, the second prisoner gives a hint for the end of the game, so it may not be totally useless.
<p><img src="images/js13k23/12.png"><br><br>
<p>There are also little details that are not visible but that I had to think through such as dynamically changing the moon phase emoji at the middle of the day in order to display the right graphics when the night comes (hence the bottom half of the time wheel that is always hidden), or making the sun or moon closer to the rotation point at midday and midnight to have it visible on screen all the time (in the witch room at least); and of course changing the windows backgrounds to dark blue when it's night time.
<br>(I even did it in the window lock puzzle even though almost no one will ever see it)
<p><img src="images/js13k23/13.png"><br><br>
<p>The only hing I didn't bother to implement was causality (when you solve a puzle then go back in time, it stays solved). It's more convenient like that for the players and for me.
