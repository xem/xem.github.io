  <h2>JS13kGames 2015 post-mortem: GeoQuiz</h2>
  <h3>august-september 2015</h3>
  <p>All code-golfers can tell you this: 13kb is huge. Even for a full-featured HTML5 game. (<a href="http://js13kgames.com/entries/alchemixer">Last year</a>, I didn't manage to use more than 9kb). But rules are rules, and this year again, we have a month to fill a 13kb zip with a high-quality game for... <b><a href="http://js13kgames.com/">js13kgames.com</a></b> !
  <p>To avoid being annoyed by such a high limit, I decided to make something big, something so big that people will ask themselves how it can fit in just 13kb. Something big enough that I would also wonder how I will pack it in 13kb... and develop my own tools to achieve that goal. Then yes, JS13kGames would be a great code-golfing and compression challenge!
  <p>Games contain code and data. 13kb of golfed code is very hard to write, so I decided to make a game that uses a lot of data. There was this Flash game that I liked a lot at university: <a href="http://www.travelpod.com/traveler-iq">Traveller's IQ challenge</a>. Its goal was to find famous places (cities, capitols, monuments...) on a World map. I chose to make a game like that, but with my own style.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <h3>A few days before the compo...</h3>
  <p><i>To be clear, the final game doesn't contain any code or data produced before the beginning of the compo. During this couple of days, I just began to develop my design/compression tools and produced dummy data that would be replaced afterwards.</i>
  <p>As I was waiting for the compo to start, I started experimenting with different techniques to store efficiently the names, capitols and shapes of all the countries of the world. I chose <a href="images/js13k15/model.png">a good-looking, yet outdated World map</a> (I did not want a Mercator projection - It's too stretched and unrealistic around the poles) and hacked a little tool that would allow me draw the outline of each country with my mouse, on a canvas. The logic was a bit similar to <a href='#js1k_floppydragon'>what I did for Flappy Dragon during JS1k 2014</a>, but with less precision, because this time, I had to draw at least 197 countries. After many experiments, I chose the following way: I placed the model of my map on a 1024 by 512px canvas. Then, for each country and for each point I clicked, the tool would gather two mouse coordinates on the map (X and Y), and append the value of X/4 and Y/2, converted in Unicode, to a string representing the given country. X/4 and Y/2 turned out to be bounded between 0 and 253, so I used one single char for each coordinate, and the character 255 ("ÿ") as a separator for the countries (like Canada) consisting of multiple islands or territories. The capitol's coordinates are appended at the end. With this technique, I could fill a JSON file that looked like this:
  <p><pre class="code">
{
    ...
    'Brazil,Brasilia': '?É?½5¢0¦/8;ABNJ»D¿BÎÿD²',
    'Bulgaria,Sofia': '{?AD|Eÿ|B',

    'Canada,Ottawa': '8"9<\nFOB\nBGA!<(...);A9D3:7?=;A9;.D+7ÿ%)\r11ÿ+\n/4/\rÿ5:4ÿ8<9\r5ÿ3=',
    <b>//   &#11014;                      &#11014;                           &#11014;      &#11014;        &#11014;           &#11014;
    // Country, capitol    Sequence of X/Y coordinates      Islands separators    Capitol coordinates</b>

    'Chile,Santiago': '7ë4È6¹2±4Ý7ï=õ;ï7ëÿ4Ì',
    'China,Beijing': '©7¢I¨W°^·\\ºj¾gÂkÈdÉXÄHËBË8Ã2ÄB¼MÿÁmÃlÂpÁoÿÂI',
    ...
}</pre>
  
  <p>But to draw the map from that JSON, it wasn't as easy and straightforward as I imagined... here are a few screenshots of my first tests featuring a low-detailed map:
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/js13k15/1.png" style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid">
  <br>
  <i>fig. 1: Unicode madness, most countries leak everywhere and half of Russia somehow gets drawn over south America.</i>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/js13k15/2.png" style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid">
  <br>
  <i>fig. 2: Debugging, displaying small dots for the capitols, redrawing countries with corrupted data...</i>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/js13k15/3.png" style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid">
  <br>
  <i>fig. 3: More debugging... drawing all countries... and realizing that many territories like Greenland and Western Sahara are not countries... Damn, Earth! :)</i>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>These tests confirmed that this project was possible. Indeed, the names, shapes and capitols of all the countries on Earth can fit in just 6.2kb in JSON. Now I'm sure there is plenty of room left for a more detailed map, plus the game's code, the music and even more data!
  <p>But I didn't stop there. I used the unused char U+254 ("þ") as a separator, and made a big string with all my JSON's data...
  <pre class="code">Algeria,AlgiersþtfpRqLiOjVc]noÿmNþArgentina,Buenos Airesþ6¸?Ã>Ï@Ö<Ù;ï7ë4Èÿ<ñ=õ@õÿ>Ðþ ... </pre>
  <p>Then I made a tool that converts this string in a binary file. After gzipping, I saw my data fell from 6.2kb to 5.6kb! 600 bytes freed so easily, <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/630818472608534528">that's a great news</a>! If you're wondering why this conversion is so efficient, it's for two main reasons. First, the JSON contained some escape sequences ("\\" instead of "\", "\r" and "\n" instead of line breaks, \' instead of quotes) that became a single byte in binary. But most of the savings come from the "code point-to-binary" conversion for all the characters between U+80 and U+FF (these characters take 2 bytes each in UTF-8, as opposed to just 1 byte if we store their code points in binary). You can find more info about how many bytes are used for each character in each charset on <a href="http://xem.github.io/charsets">this page</a>.
  
  <p>Here's a golfed encoder that does this conversion in about 230b:
  <pre class="code">
// Unicode to binary encoder
// Input (m) can contain chars between U+0 and U+255
// Output (download) is a binary file
m=m.replace(/\\\\/g,"\\").replace(/\\r/g,"\r").replace(/\\n/g,"\n").replace(/\\'/g,"'");y=[];for(i in m)y.push(m.charCodeAt(i));location="data:application/octet-stream;base64,"+btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(!1,new Uint8Array(y)))</pre>

  <p>Of course, this binary data needs to be read and converted back as a long Unicode string. I made a little JS program that does it in about 160bytes. It's totally worth the overhead, considered the hundreds of bytes that can be saved through binary.
  
  <pre class="code">
// Binary to Unicode decoder
// After execution, h contains the decoded string.
with(new XMLHttpRequest)open("GET","data.bin"),responseType='arraybuffer',send(),onload=function(){h="";for(i in u=new Uint8Array(response))h+=String.fromCharCode(u[i])}</pre>
  <p><b>Golf tip:</b> instead of data.bin, you can name your binary file "0" (or any number), without extension. It will reduce the name used in open() but also make the quotes unnecessary:
<pre class="code">with(new XMLHttpRequest)open("GET",0), ... </pre>
  <br>

  <h3>Compo: Day 1</h3>
  
  <p>When the compo started, my map editor was fully functional, and I could start developing my game for real. But before that, I wanted to experiment another thing: to represent the Earth on a 3D-looking sphere instead of always a flat map.
  <p>I didn't want to use (or make) a 3D engine just for that. I was looking for a very lightweight solution to give the illusion of a real sphere using a few tricks of trigonometry-fu, like <b>Aemkei</b> did for his <a href="http://aem1k.com/world/">1kb world</a>. I'm not an expert but, by chance, my friend <b>Subzey</b> helped me write these simple equations that turn instantly some map coordinates into a projected globe's coordinates:
  
  <pre class="code">
// map_x and map_y placed in the interval [-1:1]
globe_x = Math.sin(map_x * Math.PI) * Math.cos(map_y * Math.PI / 2);
globe_y = Math.sin(map_y * Math.PI/2);</pre>
  <br>
  <img src="images/js13k15/4.png" style="width: 250px; border: 1px solid; float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px">
  For more info, tke a look at <a href="http://codepen.io/subzey/pen/rVoXQx">this demo by Subzey</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here's <a href="images/js13k15/5.png">what I saw when I tried to adapt this technique to my map</a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  After debugging, here's a <a href="demos/js13k15/globe1.html">demo using my world map (animated)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>After long days fighting with Canada and Russia (because they are too large to behave correctly where the "-1" and the "1" are connected), I managed to hide the back side of the globe and thus, make it much more realistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here's a <a href="demos/js13k15/globe2.html">demo with only the front face of the globe (animated)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Great! Everything works. All that's left to do now is to develop the game in a few kilobytes, use another couple of kb for music, and all the rest of my zip will be used to store as many data as possible.  
  <p>The first thing I developed in the game was a "Home screen" (featuring the rotating 3D globe in more realistic colors, plus slightly blinking stars scrolling in the background), and a presentation screen for each "level" of the game.

  <h3>Compo: Day 2</h3>
  <p>I improved the graphics with better colors and gradients.

  <br>
  <p>I also began to implement a basic interactivity: showing the name of a target and a 10-second timer, clicking on the map, telling if the target has been clicked, and restarting with the next puzzle.

  <br>
  <img src="images/js13k15/11.png" style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid">
  <br>
  <p>To find if a country is clicked, I use the canvas function "ctx.isPointInPath(mouseX, mouseY)" just after drawing the country in yellow. It's very handy! But when we click outside of the country, I have to loop on all the points of the country, compute which one is the closest (computing distances using Pythagore), and use it for the green flag and the red line.

  <h3>Day 3</h3>
  <p>I started refactoring, cleaning, simplifying some code and tried to compress my data a little bit more.
  <p>Remember, in my JSON file, the islands and the capitol were separated by a "ÿ". But the capitol always corresponds to the last two chars of a country. This means I can drop the last "ÿ" in each country, and isolate the last two chars representing the capitol coordinates. With 197 countries on Earth, that's 197 bytes saved in my binary file. There's a little JS overhead to retrieve manually the coordinates, but it's worth it, because my zip is now 200 bytes smaller than before.
  It doesn't seem a lot, but 200 free bytes are great to enhance the final game's code and data. In this project, every byte counts!
  <p>I also worked on the gameplay and added an distance counter that tells you an idea of how far you are from a target. This number will be used to compute the player's score.
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/js13k15/12.png" style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid">
  <br>
  <p>Of course, Pythagore isn't a great solution to compute distances on a sphere projected on a map, but for now it works well enough. I'll enhance the formula if I have the time and the bytes for it...
  <p>I also worked on the gameplay of the level 2 (finding capitols):
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/js13k15/13.png" style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid">
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/js13k15/14.png" style="width: 600px; border: 1px solid">
  <p>... and worked on the scoring system (your "error gauge" decreases after every mistake and if it reaches 0, the game is over).
  <br>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <h3>Day 4</h3>
  <p>With a little help from my friends, I produced an important chunk of data: the names and positions of famous places on Earth. There are 100 of them, separated in 3 categories (easy, medium, hard). The compression technique is about the same as the countries and capitols. The data looks like this:
  <pre class="code">Christ the RedeemerHºþThe Great Chinese WallÁIþThe Great SphinxZþThe Eiffel Towerm9þ...</pre>
  <p>The coordinates are glued to the places' names (similarly to the capitols), and all the places are separated by the character "þ".

  <h2>JS1k 2015 post-mortem</h2>
  <h3>february 2015</h3>
  <p>This month was very busy! I spent almost all my free time <s>working</s> golfing for JS1k.</p>
  <br>
  <p>➾ I contributed to <a href="http://subzey.github.io/js1k2015invitro/" target=_blank>the great invitro</a> made by @subzey, by finding a brand new compression technique, allowing to hash the canvas properties as well as the canvas functions.
  <br>You can read more about it in <a href="https://github.com/subzey/js1k2015/tree/master/postmortem" target=_blank>his post mortem</a> and the discussion in <a href="https://github.com/Siorki/RegPack/issues/21" target=_blank>this RegPack ticket</a>.
  <br>It was very exciting to discover this new technique and save about 50 bytes on a demo we thought we couldn't compress anymore!</p>
  <br>

  <br>
  <p>➾ I gathered the best code-golfed games and apps made during the past months by "the codegolf team" into three compilations:
  <br><br>- <a href="http://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2121" target=_blank>Mini Apps Collection</a><br>Featuring 7 apps! Mini Code Editor, HTML & CSS minifier, hex viewer, dataURI converter, spritesheet and JSPerf.<br>(1477b minified, 1024b regpacked)
  <br><br>- <a href="http://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2100" target=_blank>Mini Games Collection #1</a><br>Mine Sweeper, Pop Tiles, and Game of Life.<br>(1221b minified, 1023b regpacked)
  <br><br>- <a href="http://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2145" target=_blank>Mini Games Collection #2</a><br>Simon with sound and 2048.<br>(1220b minified, 1022b regpacked)
  <br><br>It took a lot of time to fit each of these compilations in 1k, which involved removing some features not compatible with js1k's rules (like accessing "top" and localStorage"), managing to inject big chunks of HTML and JS into the shim with many "document.write", "innerHTML" and "outerHTML"-based hacks, and optimizing the whole code for a better RegPack compression (by repeating code as much as possible, sometimes in very silly ways)...
  <br><br>Thanks to @p01, @subzey, @aemkei, @LauckAndLoad, @bburky, @mathias and @veubeke for their contribution in each of these projects!
  <br>You can read more about these apps and games (and their original projects) by clicking the "demo details" button on each demo.

  <p>➾The theme was "Hype Train", so I couldn't resist making <a href="http://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2160" target=_blank>this little hommage</a> to asdfmovie's sequence <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DjOL2we8ko" target=_blank>I like trains</a>. The code has nothing special, just a lot of points coordinates and a loop displaying them with moveTo and lineTo's. This kind of "monotonous" source code packs very well (1472b minified - 902b regpacked)
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/js1k15-3.png"></p>
  <br>

  <br>
  <p>➾ The biggest challenge was of course my "serious" entry, <a href="http://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2316" target=_blank>hypeRcube</a>!</p>
  <p>With all the success of the 3D demos during the past years, my idea was to produce the first 4D demo of JS1k, featuring an "hypercube" (the 4D equivalent of a 3D cube). I had no precise idea of what I would (or could) do in 1k, but I aimed for some kind of animated / rotating hypercube, like the ones we can see on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract" target=_blank>wikipedia's gifs</a>.</p>
  <p>It took more than 10 iterations (10 more or less big rewrites) to become what it is today, and each of these rewrites was marked by a new exciting feature, a compression breakthrough, or a funny bug that made me understand that I was not on the good path. You can tke a look at these beta versions here:</p>
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/0.html">Proof of concept</a>, very laggy but featuring an intro, perspective, camera rotation and the 6 4D rotations (3.1kb minified, and only 1.3kb regpacked, due to heavy code reuse). This PoC convinced me that doing a 4D demo for js1k was possible! (<a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/566610056540852225" target=_blank>tweet</a>)
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/1.html">Beta #1</a>, with more reactive buttons, and intensive golfing (2.0kb minified, 1.1kb regpacked) 
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/2.html">Beta #2</a>, almost fitting in 1k (1.9kb minified, 1037b regpacked)
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/3.html">Beta #3</a>, golfed intensively (1.6kb minified, 963b regpacked). From this point I knew that I would be able to add many more features and graphical enhancements in my 1kb demo!<br>Actually, I added features and golfed them at the same time to stay as close as possible to 1kb.
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/4.html">Beta #4</a>, adding colors, and allowing to play/pause animations... but it's so slow ! (1.5B minified, 1022b regpacked) - <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/566615949009498113" target=_blank>funny</a>... <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/566629132935901184" target=_blank>bugs</a>.
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/5.html">Beta #5</a>, enhancing speed and adding a perspective slider going from an isometric view (2.5D) to an exaggerated 3D view... (1.5kb minified, 1030b regpacked)
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/6.html">Beta #6</a>, adding two color pickers and optimizing the workflow for RegPack (reusing the vars produced by RegPack and putting all the code in a string that will execute itself repeatedly using a timeout (1.58kb minified, 1042b regpacked) - the main achievement here was to achieve drawing the hypercube in a single pass, using only connected edges and not passing more than one time by the same edge, thanks to <a href="images/js1k15-4.png" target=_blank>this <s>wonderful</s> crazy path</a> I've drawn on paint (other funny <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/566947180267982849" target=_blank>bug</a>)
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/7.html">Beta #7</a>, YAY EPILEPTIC PARTY! very buggy but I find it artistic. (see <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/567068576239345665" target=_blank>gif</a>)
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/8.html">Beta #8</a>, stabilized and golfed a bit more (1.56kb minified, 974b regpacked)
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/9.html">Beta #9</a>, I tried to fill the hypercube in red but it was a bad idea. (<a href="https://twitter.com/MaximeEuziere/status/569130388939010049" target=_blank>related tweet</a>)
  <p>&bull; <a href="demos/hypercube/10.html">Beta #10</a> finished, with an extra feature to slow down or speed up the animation (1.57kb minified, 1021b regpacked)
  <p>Making this demo helped me understand better the 4th dimension, and even if I only scratched the surface, I find it amazing. I was surprised to see so many features and graphic effects fit in 1kb, thanks to many epic golfing tricks, but also hand-made line-drawing (see demo #6), as well as dirty hacks to optimize the code for RegPack (repeating big chunks as much as possible to reduce entropy), and faking the perspective effect by just drawing lines on a canvas and making the points closer to each other to give the impression that they are further from the camera...</p>
  <p>To achieve so many things, the secret holds in two words: passion and organization. If you want to see how organized it is, you can read the source code below. I detailed it as much as I could to make it useful for anyone wanting to discover the tricks used inside.
  <p>Thanks for your attention and see you next year!

// * RegPacked (NB: in RegPack settings, add "a b c _ X Y Z" to the list of unrenamable vars)
// and the result is submitted to js1k


// What happens in this demo
// =========================
// - When the demo loads, Regpack generates and evals a string: _.
// - It also leaves the variable g to null
// - When _ is eval'ed, it draws the current frame and sets a timeout to re-eval itself, and so on
      

// Variables
// =========

// a: canvas
// b: body
// c: canvas context2d
// d: which animation (0: none, 1: X, 2: Y, 3: Z)
// e: animation direction (1 = forward, 3 = backwards)
// f: array containing the coordinates of all the points of the tesseract (to read 3 by 3). They are arranged to form a hamiltonian path where all edges are used only once (see http://img.ctrlv.in/img/15/02/14/54dfca5f4c396.png)
// g: null at the beginning, then truthy while the demo plays
// h: rotation state (0: pause, 1: play)
// i: iterator
// j: lines color's input
// k: perspective (-10 to 10: 2.5d do exaggerated 3D)
// l: mouse X
// m: mouse Y
// n: demo state (0: pause, 1: play)
// o: demo frame counter
// p: rotation frame counter
// q: number of frames in an animation loop
// r: unused
// s: unused
// t: temp var
// u: X coordinate of each point projected on a cube (0 => 1, 1 => 1, 2 => 2, 3 => 2)
// v: Y coordinate of each point projected on a cube
// w: Z coordinate of each point projected on a cube
// x: X coordinate of each point in the tesseract
// y: Y coordinate of each point in the tesseract
// z: Z coordinate of each point in the tesseract


// This simulates the state of _ and g after unpacking.
_ = "";

  <p>In case you were wondering, yeah, I used almost all the alphabet as variable names. This demo contains a big state machine needing all those variables. And yes, it's a heart at the end of the RegPacked code, because I had 3 bytes left and "eval(_) <3" is totally valid. It's useless but it's my way to say that the demo was made with love! :D

	<h2>JS13k 2014 post-mortem </h2>
	<h3>september 2014</h3>
  <p><a href=//js13kgames.com>JS13kgames</a> is an annual code golfing competition where you can build (desktop / mobile / server-based) HTML5 games that have to fin in a 13kb zip.</p>
  <p>13kb is <a href=//twitter.com/mrspeaker/status/234946942214496256>like, infinity</a> for extreme code golfers, but we decided to give it a try anyway:</p>
  <p>I made <b>AlcheMixer</b> by myself, you can try it <a href=//js13kgames.com/entries/alchemixer>here</a></p>
  <p>I also made <b>Quintessence</b> with @subzey and @nderscore, you can try it <a href=//js13kgames.com/entries/quintessence>here</a> and read @subzey's great notes <a href=//gist.github.com/subzey/b18c482922cd17693d65>here</a>!</p>
  <p>Sadly, we didn't have time, and didn't even need, to golf the source code of those games, as they were way under the 13kb mark at the end of the month... But it was fun anyway!</p>
  <p>Hope you like them! For the record, AlcheMixer was ranked 72th in the desktop games category and Quintessence 8th in the mobile games category.</p>

	<h2>DOM oddities</h2>
	<h3>july-october 2014</h3>
  <p>This article will cover a few oddities I found by writing bizarre HTML and inspecting the DOM. I'll update it when I find new things:
  <hr>
  <p><b>Head</b>
  <p>The HEAD element is hidden by default on all Web pages.
  <br>
  It can contain elements such as META, TITLE, LINK, STYLE, SCRIPT and BASE.
  <br>
  But what happens when you force them to be visible, and editable? Here's the answer: <a href=//xem.github.io/show>Show</a> !
  <br>
  <br>
  <iframe src="https://xem.github.io/show" width=700 height=700></iframe>
  <p>As you can see, all those elements can behave like regular DIVs. Even the META, LINK and BASE can become containers, even if they are generally used as self-contained elements (without children nor closing tag). Some browsers even allow to edit the TITLE block and update the browser's titlebar accordingly. Also, the LINK element is shown as an Anchor even though it's not really clickable.
  <hr>
  <p><b>Paragraphs</b>
  <p>&bull; A paragraph can't contain another paragraph. If you try to do something like &lt;p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;/p>, not two but three neighbours &lt;P>s are added in the DOM: the outer one, the inner one, and an empty one caused by the final &lt;/p>. Anyway, they won't be nested:
  <br>
  <br>
  <iframe src="https://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/1.1/#%7Fp%20{%20background%3A%20%23def%3B%20padding%3A%2010px%20}%7F%3Cp%3EOuter%3Cp%3Einner%3C/p%3E%3C/p%3E1" width=700 height=400></iframe>
  <p>Same thing if you change their display to "inline", they can't be nested at all:
  <br>
  <br>
  <iframe src="https://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/1.1/#%7Fp%20{%0A%20%20display%20%3A%20inline%3B%20%0A%20%20background%3A%20%23def%3B%0A%20%20padding%3A%2010px%3B%0A%20%20margin%3A%2010px%0A}%7F%3Cp%3EOuter%20%3Cp%3Einner%3C/p%3E%3C/p%3E1" width=700 height=400></iframe>
  <br>
  ... Unless you write the inner paragraph with JS:
  <br><br>
  <iframe src="http://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/1.1/#p.innerHTML%20%3D%20%22%3Cp%3EYo%22p%20%7B%20background%3A%20%23def%3B%20border%3A%201px%20dotted%20red%20%7D%3Cp%20id%3Dp%3E1" width=700 height=400></iframe>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <p><b>Anchors</b>
  <br>
  Anchors (&lt;A>) behave like paragraphs in the sense that they can't be nested:
  <br>
  <br>
  <iframe src="https://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/1.1/#%7Fa%20{%20background%3A%20%23def%3B%20margin%3A%2010px%3B%20padding%3A%2010px%20}%7F%3Ca%3ELink%201%0A%3Ca%3Elink%202%0A1" width=700 height=400></iframe>
  <br>
  But something strange happens when you try to nest an anchor in a paragraph in an anchor:
  <br>
  <br>
  <iframe src="https://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/1.1/#%7Fa%20{%20float%3A%20left%3B%20padding%3A%2010px%3B%20margin%3A%2010px%3B%20background%3A%20%23def%20}%7F%3Ca%3ELink%201%0A%3Cp%3E%0A%3Ca%3ELink%2021" width=700 height=400></iframe>
  <br>
  That's right, a third empty A is added into the DOM! Go figure...
  <br>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p><b>HTML, HEAD and BODY</b>
  <br>
  <p>The HTML, HEAD and BODY tags are optional in the HTML source, but are automatically added in the DOM by the browsers. Did you know they can be removed too?</p>
  <iframe src="http://xem.github.io/miniCodeEditor/1.1/#%3Chtml%20id%3Dhtml%3E%0A%3Chead%20id%3Dhead%3E%0A%20%20%3Cstyle%3Ebody%20%7Bbackground%3A%20%23def%20%7D%3C/style%3E%0A%3C/head%3E%0A%3Cbody%20id%3Dbody%3E%0A%20%20%3Cbutton%20onclick%3Dhtml.remove%28%29%3ERemove%20HTML%3C/button%3E%0A%20%20%3Cbutton%20onclick%3Dhead.remove%28%29%3ERemove%20HEAD%3C/button%3E%0A%20%20%3Cbutton%20onclick%3Dbody.remove%28%29%3ERemove%20BODY%3C/button%3E%0A%3C/body%3E%0A%3C/html%3E1" width=700 height=400></iframe>

  <p>There's another thing that browsers do automatically: they place some HTML tags in the HEAD and other tags in the BODY, as long as they are in the right order: </p>

  <p>But if your HTML source contains HEAD-related elements after BODY-related elements, they'll be in the body (but they'll stay hidden, of course):</p>

  <p><h3>The idea</h3>
  <p>Subzey and I code-golfed <a href=//xem.github.io/MiniSweeper/ target=_blank>a minesweeper game in 480b</a> in 2013 and it was really fun and very instructive.
  <p>So, for JS1k 2014, I gave ourselves a big challenge: to fit as many 2-player games as possible in 1kb. Who knows, we could maybe fit three, four, five simple games in 1k...?
  <p>People have already made awesome 2-player games for JS1k (<a href=//js1k.com/2014-dragons/demo/1720 target=_blank>1</a>, <a href=//js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1319 target=_blank>2</a>, <a href=//js1k.com/2011-dysentery/demo/941 target=_blank>3</a>, <a href=//js1k.com/2011-dysentery/demo/947 target=_blank>4</a>, <a href=//js1k.com/2010-first/demo/679 target=_blank>5</a>, <a href=//js1k.com/2010-first/demo/430 target=_blank>6</a>, <a href=//js1k.com/2010-first/demo/41 target=_blank>7</a>, <a href=//js1k.com/2010-first/demo/23 target=_blank>8</a>, <a href=//js1k.com/2010-first/demo/430 target=_blank>9</a>), but we've never seen game compilations, and that's why I chose to try that. I chose five board games:   Tic-Tac-Toe, Tic-Tac-Toe 3D, Four in a row, Reversi and Checkers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, we tried to implement those games separately, in good old HTML and JS (the boards are made with tables, not drawn on the canvas):
  <img src=images/2pg1.png width=700>
  <br>
  We quickly (and sadly) abandoned the last two games (reversi and checkers) because the first three already needed more than 2kb.
  <br>
  We gathered those 3 games into one, and golfed them as much as possible, until the whole demo could fit in 1kb. This process included reducing the graphics to the strict minimum (just tables, X and O's). It actually went under 750b, and from that point, we had to decide whether to enhance the graphics or add a fourth game. We decided to make 4 games in one (because that would be impressive), and make a 2k version with great graphics.
  <br>
  Besides the graphics, almost all our efforts have been made on the 1k version and its 4 games. Actually, we golfed that demo on three levels!
  <br>
  <hr>
  <p><b>1st level of golf: JS optimisation</b>
  <p>The first goal is indeed to have the shortest JS code possible.<br>
  A lot of effort has been made to fit the menu + the four playable games in 1613b.
  <p>The games needed a lot of variables, and we had to introduce 23 global vars. Almost all the alphabet, and most of them are heavily reused.
  <p>To save bytes and avoid any kind of DOM manipulation, all the elements on the screen are redrawn after each player's move.
  <p>Here's the program's structure:
  <pre class=code>// Draw function
a=function(c,d,e){
  
  // Init HTML (menu)
  // When a button of the menu is clicked, the game state is reset,
  // and the model m (an array representing the board) is initialized.
  h="&lt;center>&lt;font face=arial>&lt;p>&lt;button onclick=m=[];f=2;a(p=g=s=1)>XnO&lt;button onclick=m=[];f=3;a(p=g=s=1)>XnO3D&lt;button onclick=m=[];f=1;a(p=g=s=1)>Find4&lt;button onclick=m=[];f=w=0;m[27]=m[36]=-1;m[28]=m[35]=1;a(p=g=s=1)>Flip&lt;/button>&lt;p>";
  
  // If a game has been started
  if(c){

    // write table HTML (the board) according to the model
    // ... snip ...
    
    // Write informations under the board (current player, winner, ...)
    // ... snip ...

  }
  
  // Update page's &lt;body>
  b.innerHTML=h;
}

// Show the menu on load
a();

// Onclick (when a player clicks on the board to play)
q=function(c,d,e){
  
  // If the game is not over and the cell is empty
  if(g&&!m[c]){
  
    // Current player plays current game and updates the model
    // ... snip ...

    // Change player
    p=-p;
    
    // Redraw everything
    a(1);
  }
}</pre>
  <p>The board drawing snippet is very simple, and made of three loops. One for the boards, another one for the lines, and a last one for the cells of each line, depending on the model. "f" represents the current game (0: reversi / 1: find 4 / 2: XnO / 3: XnO 3D).
  <p>&lt;P>, &lt;TR> and &lt;TH> elements don't need to be closed.
  <p>&lt;TH> elements have the advantage of being bold and centered, but their borders are hidden when they are empty. That's why we use the blank character \xa0 in the empty cells. (i.e. the 0's in the model.)
  <pre class=code>// Loop on tables, write table HTML
for(i="1113"[f];i--;){

  h+="&lt;/table>&lt;p>&lt;table border>";

  // Loop on lines
  for(j="8633"[f];j--;)

    // Write line HTML, loop on cells
    for(h+="&lt;tr>",k="8733"[f];k--;)
    
      // Write cell HTML
      h+="&lt;th width=20 onclick=q("+[l,7-j,7-k]+") id=t"+l+">"+"X\xa0O"[1+(m[l]=m[l++]||0)];
}
h+="&lt;/table>&lt;p>";</pre>
<p>The rules of each game were reduced to their minimum after a lot of iterations. After each click, the game updates the model and checks for a victory:<p>
<p><b>Tic-Tac-Toe, Tic-Tac-Toe 3D:</b>
<pre class=code>for(i=3;i--;)
  for(j=3;j--;)
    if(
      k=i*9,
      l=j*3,

      // In the model, the players marks are represented as 1 and -1.
      // If 3 or -3 is found in this array representing all the possible alignments,

<p><b>2nd level of golf: RegPack optimization</b>
<p>The JS source could be much smaller than that, but when you deal with JS packers, the main rule is not to be short, it is to repeat yourself as much as possible. That's why many snippets of the code are arranged (and sometimes "unoptimized" to have a better result in a JS packer.

	<h2>JS1k 2014 post-mortem: Floppy Dragon</h2>
	<h3>febuary 2014</h3>
  <p>Welcome to the making-of of <a href=//js1k.com/2014-dragons/demo/1704 target=_blank>Floppy Dragon</a>, my individual entry for <a href=//js1k.com target=_blank>JS1k</a> 2014.
  <p>In febuary 2014, all the Internet was talking about the game Flappy Bird, so I decided (for fun) to make a mini-game inspired by that, but featuring a dragon instead of a bird, and stalactites in a cave instead of pipes. I also wanted to introduce many cool details such as responsive display, nice animated graphics, random maps, increasing speed and difficulty, textual interface, etc. And, of course, it had to fit in 1k of JavaScript.

  <p><h3>Responsive display</h3>
  <img src=images/fd1.png width=700>
  <p>In JS1k entries, <b>a</b> represents a fullscreen canvas, and <b>c</b> represents the 2D context of this canvas. On load, the canvas' width and height are automatically set to the innerWidth and innerHeight of the window. There are many ways to draw into this canvas, but I chose the following approach:<br>
  First, I scale the canvas' context with this ratio:
  <pre class=code>c.scale(a.height/1E3,a.height/1E3);</pre>
  Then, the game just has to draw on the canvas' context as if it was 1000px high and infinitely long, and the drawing will spread on all the screen.
  <p>For the orange background, I simply draw a huge rectangle on the canvas when I start rendering each frame:
  <pre class=code>// Background
c.fillStyle="#E50";
c.fillRect(0,0,4E4,4E4);</pre>
  <hr>
  <p><h3>Random map</h3>
  <img src=images/fd2.png width=700>
  <p>In the source code of Floppy Dragon, there's a little piece of code that initializes the game. This code is executed on load, but also when the player loses and decides to try again. In this snippet, I generate an array <b>g</b> with 1000 random integers between 0 and 7, stored from index 0 and index 1000:
  <pre class=code>g=[];
for(o=0;o<1E3;o++)
  g[o]=g[o+1E3]=8*Math.random()|1-1;</pre>
  <p>In the game loop, this array is used as a heightmap to draw the upper and lower walls of the cave, and the obstacles:<br>
  A new "step" is drawn every 40px to make the walls look less flat, and an obstacle is drawn every 20 steps. All these points depend on the heightmap values. The obstacles use these values x 100.
  <p>To sum up, the walls are just two big polygons that are drawn with a very similar code, the only difference is that they are mirrored and show the obstacles in a complementary way (a 300px gap is kept between each pair of stalactites)
  In the following code, k represents the horizontal offset of the scene. This rendering is performed at each frame.
  <pre class=code>// Draw the walls
c.fillStyle="#920";

// Roof
c.beginPath();
c.moveTo(-k,0);
for(o=2E3;o--;)
  o%20
  ?
  // Wall
  c.lineTo(40*o-k,20+4*g[o])
  :
  // Obstacle
  (c.lineTo(40*o-k,100*g[o]),c.lineTo(40*o-k-4,100*g[o]));
c.lineTo(40*o-k,0);
c.fill();

// Ceiling
c.beginPath();
c.moveTo(-k,2E3);
for(o=2E3;o--;)
  o%20
  ?
  // Wall 
  c.lineTo(40*o-k,980-4*g[o])
  :
  // Obstacle
  (c.lineTo(40*o-k,100*(g[o]+3)),c.lineTo(40*o-k-4,100*(g[o]+3)));
c.lineTo(40*o-k,1E3);
c.fill();</pre>
  <p>The maps repeats itself every 1000 steps, thanks to this code that goes 4000px back as soon as the game scrolls more than 4000px:
  <pre>// Loop on the map if we are far enough
  d&&!e&&(k+=20,4E4&lt;k&&(k-=4E4));</pre>
  <hr>
  <p><h3>User interface</h3>
  <p>The user interface is made of different texts showing the game name, the score, and a start / restart message. These texts are centered and scaled. In the following code, <b>d</b> is set if the game is started, <b>f</b> is the score, and <b>e</b> is set if the game is over.
  <pre class=code>// Text
  c.fillStyle="#fff";
  c.font="6em Arial";
  d&&c.fillText(f,a.width/(a.height/1E3)/2-30*1,500);
  d||c.fillText("#FloppyDragon",a.width/(a.height/1E3)/2-30*11,500);
  e&&c.fillText("score",a.width/(a.height/1E3)/2-30*4,400);
  c.fillText(e?"restart":!d?"start":"",a.width/(a.height/1E3)/2-30*5,600);</pre>
  <p>User interface also means controls, and the controls are simple: press any key or click or tap to start, flap, or restart. When those events are fired, the "reset sequence" is executed (if the game is over), or the dragon flaps (if the game is running, or starting). <b>h</b> represents the vertical speed of the dragon, <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> represent its coordinates, and <b>l</b> is the game's speed.
  <pre>// Controls
ontouchstart=onmousedown=onkeydown=function(){
  
  // If game is over, reset
  if(e){
    d=e=f=h=0;
    g=[];
    for(o=0;o<1E3;o++)
      g[o]=g[o+1E3]=8*Math.random()|1-1;
    i=j=300;
    k=20;
    l=50;
  }
  
  // If game is not over, start the game if it's not started, and jump
  else{
    h=45;
    d=1;
  }
};</pre>
  <p>Talking about framerate, as I explained earlier, the game's speed is increasing. A variable (<b>l</b>) holds the number of milliseconds between each frame. It starts at 50 and is decremented after each obstacle passed, with a lower limit of 20. The rendering function is called recursively with the corresponding timeout:
  <pre class=code>// Game loop
(n=function(){

  // ... snip ...
  
  // Increase score and game speed after each obstacle
  !d||e||(k+280)%800||(f++,20&lt;l&&l--);
  
  // ... snip ...
  
  // Loop
  setTimeout(n,l)
})()</pre>
  <p>At each frame, we also apply gravity (i.e. increment the vertical coordinate of the dragon)
  <pre class=code>// Apply gravity if the game has started
d&&(h-=6);</pre>
  <p>Finally, we have to detect when the game is lost (when the dragon's head hits the floor or the ceiling or an obstacle. Here's how it is done:
  <pre class=code>// Game over
if(50>j||950<j||!((k+300)%800)&&(j<100*g[20*~~(k/800)+20]+50||j>100*g[20*~~(k/800)+20]+250))
  e=1;</pre>
  <hr>
  <p><h3>Draw the dragon</h3>
  <p>Last but not least, when all the game mechanics are ready, and the code is minified and packed, I have only 360 bytes left to draw the hero of the game: the dragon.
  I thought I could simply use a unicode character such as <a href=//www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f409/index.htm target=_blank>U+1F409</a> or <a href=//www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f432/index.htm target=_blank>U+1F432</a>. But these models are not very good-looking, and they aren't displayed correctly on all browsers.
  <p>I could also use pixel art (<a href=//js1k.com/2014-dragons/demo/1659 target=_blank>like this</a>) or bezier curves (<a href=//js1k.com/2014-dragons/demo/1648 target=_blank>like that</a>) but this would have used too many characters to draw what I had in mind.
  <p>So I decided to draw a shape made of tiny lines, and compress it with a home-made technique:
  <img src=images/fd3.png>
  <p>The shape starts at the neck of the dragon. Each point of the shape has coordinates very close to the previous point. My goal was to store the X and Y coordinates of each point in an unique ASCII character. So I stored the X offset in the first 3 bits of each character (range: -4 to +4), and the Y offset in the last 4 bits (range: -8 to +8).
  <p>As a result, I was able to represent the dragon's body plus the two different wings shapes in just 196 characters (most of these are invisible).
  <pre class=code>p="fEFf&{{~_=,;=vviJ.jfVi/.OoyizyhkhEwf74)\n$fwwuvtU`"+(10&lt;h?"iZ[*)yj:*im**y|Ktdww54#5Dy\iz[Kzi[Jiijk[e@1!":"zl]LfU{\lKtBUh{zzU66iigig5\n&iiyz{vfwwiyDfwiiE");</pre>
  <p>And here is the code that draws the full shape at the good coordinates. Note that the coordinates are inverted when the dragon dies, in order to draw the falling animation.
  <pre class=code>
  c.fillStyle="#000";
  c.beginPath();
  c.moveTo(v=i,w=(j-=h));
  for(o in p){
    y=8-2*(p.charCodeAt(o)>>4);
    z=16-2*(p.charCodeAt(o)&15);
    c.lineTo(v+=(e?y:z),w+=(e?-z:y));
  }
  c.fill();</pre>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <p>To finish, a few final optimizations and JScrush helped me fit this game in 1024 bytes, and I submitted it two weeks after the beginning of the contest. It had the honor to be mentioned <a href=//twitter.com/js1k/status/433406361087401984 target=_blank>here</a> and <a href=//qfox.nl/weblog/312 target=_blank>here</a> by Peter van der Zee, who organizes JS1k every year.

	<h2>Implicit getElementById's</h2>
	<h3>october 2013</h3>
	<div id=getelementbyid>
		<p>What is the most useful JavaScript function, but also the most annoying to write? <b>document.getElementById()</b>, of course! It is so useful, and so long, that every decent JS library contains an alias for to call it easily (generally <b>$()</b>).</p>
    <p>But did you know that we often don't even need to call it? Indeed, all the browsers in use today (including IE6+) allow to access to an HTML element by using directly its <b>id</b> as a global var! It's a non-standard feature, yet it works very well everywhere.</p>
    <pre>&lt;div id="myId">&lt;/div>
&lt;script>
  alert(myId);                            // --> [object HTMLDivElement]
  alert(myId.id);                         // --> "myId"
  alert(window.myId.id);                  // --> "myId"
  alert(this.myId.id);                    // --> "myId"
  alert(self.myId.id);                    // --> "myId"
  alert('myId' in window);                // --> true
  alert(window.hasOwnProperty("myId"));   // --> true
&lt;/script></pre>
    <p>So "myId" is a property of window, but it's not "enumerable", so we can't see it by ny making a loop or a console.dir() on the window object:</p>
    <pre>
// Display the content of window:
console.dir(window);                      // myId is not présent.

// Loop through the properties of window:
var present = false;
for(var i in window){
  if(i == 'myId'){
    present = true;
  }
}
alert(present);                           // --> false
    </pre>
    <p>I experimented with this "feature" and found some funny things:</p>
    <p><b>An implicit id can't have the same name as a protected JS keyword:</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=function>&lt;/div>
&lt;script>alert(function) // SyntaxError: Unexpected token )&lt;/script></pre>
		<br>
    <p><b>An implicit getElementById can't overload a native global var, such as window.screen:</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=screen><&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  screen.innerHTML = "screen";          // --> nothing happens
  alert(screen);                        // --> [object Screen]
&lt;/script></pre>
		<br>
    <p><b>Also, it can't redefine a global var defined earlier</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;script>
  global0 = 1;
&lt;/script>

&lt;div id=global0><&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  global0.innerHTML = "global0";        // --> nothing happens
  alert(global0);                       // --> 1
&lt;/script></pre>
		<br>
    <p><b>A global var defined with the "window." prefix can overload an implicit getElementById</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=global1>&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  global1.innerHTML = "global1";        // --> the div contains the text "global1" 
  console.log(global1);                 // --> [object HTMLDivElement]
  window.global1 = 1;                   // Try to overload global1
  console.log(global1);                 // --> 1
&lt;/script></pre>
    <br>
    <p><b>If we try to overloas an implicit getElementById with a global var defined without any prefix, this is what happens:</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=global2>&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  global2.innerHTML = "global2";        // --> the div contains the text "global2" 
  try{global2 = 1}                      // Try to overload global2
  catch(e){alert(e)}                    // --> TypeError on IE < 9 / no error on other browsers
  console.log(global2);                 // --> [object HTMLDivElement] on IE < 9 / 1 on other browsers
&lt;/script></pre>
    <br>
    <p><b>Finally, if we try to overload an implicit getElementById with a global var defined with a "var", this is what happens:</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=global3>&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  global3.innerHTML = "global3";        // --> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of undefined
  console.log(global3);                 // --> undefined
  var global3 = 1;                      // --> Try to overload global3
  console.log(global3);                 // --> 1
&lt;/script></pre>
    <br>
    <p>In this case, the keyword "var" on line 3 changes the order in which the JS code is parsed, and it breaks the lines 1 and 2.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>To conclude, this technique is useful in some particular cases where we don't want to use a heavy library nor call the long function <b>document.getElementById()</b>, especially in code golfing contests. But in real life, it's safer to use the good old native methods because the implicit <b>document.getElementById</b> comes with several traps, and can lead to hours of debugging...</p>

	<h2>Les "getElementById" implicites</h2>
	<h3>octobre 2013</h3>
	<div id=getelementbyid_fr>
		<p>Quelle fonction JavaScript est la plus utile, et la plus embêtante à écrire? <b>document.getElementById()</b>, bien sûr! C'est tellement utile, et tellement long que toute librairie JS digne de ce nom crée un alias (généralement <b>$()</b>) pour pouvoir l'appeler facilement.</p>
    <p>Mais saviez-vous qu'on n'a, bien souvent, même pas besoin de l'appeler? En effet, tous les navigateurs qu'on peut trouver en circulation aujourd'hui (y compris IE6+) permettent d'accéder à un élément HTML en utilisant directement son <b>id</b> comme une variable globale! C'est un fonctionnement complètement non-standard, mais qui a le bon goût de marcher partout, et extrêmement bien.</p>
    <pre>&lt;div id="monId">&lt;/div>
&lt;script>
  alert(monId);                           // --> [object HTMLDivElement]
  alert(monId.id);                        // --> "monId"
  alert(window.monId.id);                 // --> "monId"
  alert(this.monId.id);                   // --> "monId"

  alert('monId' in window);               // --> true
  alert(window.hasOwnProperty("monId"));  // --> true
&lt;/script></pre>
    <p>"monId" est bien une propriété window, mais il n'est pas énumérable, autrement dit, on ne tombera pas dessus si on fait une boucle ou un console.dir():</p>
    <pre>
// On affiche le contenu de window:
console.dir(window);                      // monId n'est pas présent.

// On itère sur les propriétés de window:
var present = false;
for(var i in window){
  if(i == 'monId'){
    present = true;
  }
}
alert(present);                           // --> false
    </pre>
    <p>J'ai fait quelques expériences avec cette "fonctionnalité", et j'ai découvert des choses rigolotes:</p>
    <p><b>Un id implicite ne peut pas avoir le même nom qu'un mot-clé JavaScript protégé</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=function>&lt;/div>
&lt;script>alert(function) // SyntaxError: Unexpected token )&lt;/script></pre>
		<br>
    <p><b>Un getElementById implicite ne peut pas écraser une variable globale native, par exemple window.screen:</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=screen><&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  screen.innerHTML = "screen";          // --> rien ne se passe
  alert(screen);                        // --> [object Screen]
&lt;/script></pre>
		<br>
    <p><b>Il ne peut pas non plus écraser une variable globale définie auparavant:</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;script>
  global0 = 1;
&lt;/script>

&lt;div id=global0><&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  global0.innerHTML = "global0";        // --> rien ne se passe
  alert(global0);                       // --> 1
&lt;/script></pre>
		<br>
    <p><b>Une variable globale définie avec le préfixe "window." peut écraser un getElementById implicite</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=global1>&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  global1.innerHTML = "global1";        // --> la div contient le texte "global1"

    <br>
    <p><b>Si on essaye d'écraser un getElementById implicite avec une variable globale définie sans aucun préfixe, voici ce qui se passe:</b></p>
    <pre>&lt;div id=global2>&lt;/div>

&lt;script>
  global2.innerHTML = "global2";        // --> la div contient le texte "global2"

  console.log(global3);                 // --> 1
&lt;/script></pre>
    <br>
    <p>Dans ce cas-là, la présence du mot-clé "var" à la ligne 3 change l'ordre dans lequel le code JS est parsé, et ça fait bugger les lignes 1 et 2.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>En conclusion, cette astuce est pratique dans quelques cas particuliers où on souhaite ni installer une lourde librairie, ni appeler la longue fonction <b>document.getElementById()</b>, notamment dans des épreuves de code golfing. Mais dans le cadre professionnel, il est plus prudent de continuer à utiliser les bonnes vieilles méthodes natives car les pièges des <b>document.getElementById</b> implicites sont nombreux, et ça peut mener à des heures de débogage...</p>

	<h2>The joys of text-shadow... on IE.</h2>
	<h3>septembre 2013</h3>
	<div id=text-shadow_en>
		<p>We don't present <b>text-shadow</b> anymore, this CSS property allowing to set a shadow to a text.<br>(see: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#text-shadow" target=_blank>the specs</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/CSS/text-shadow" target=-blank>the MDN page</a>)</p>
		<p>Many browsers have some small implementation problems, but the worst are, of course, the old IE. More precisely, IE &lt; 10.</p>
		<p>However, those browsers have access to proprietary "filters", created by Microsoft, and allowing to achieve a similar effect.<br>Sometimes, we have no other choice than using them. This article explains how.</p>
		<p>Two filters allow to simulate shadows: Shadow and Glow.</p>
		<p><b>Here is the "Shadow" version:</b></p>
		<p>CSS:</p>
		<pre style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: auto">h1 {
<br>
&nbsp; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px #ff0000; /* IE10+, Firefox 3.5+, Opera 9.5+, Chrome, Safari, and mobile browsers */
<br>
&nbsp; filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#ff0000', Direction=135, Strength=3); zoom: 1; /* IE 6-9 */
<br>
}</pre>
		<p>HTML:</p>
		<pre>&lt;h1>Shadowed title&lt;/h1></pre>
		<p>Rendu:</p>
  	<style class=hidden>h1.ombre1 { text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px #ff0000; filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#ff0000', Direction=135, Strength=3); zoom: 1; }</style>
		<div class=demo>
			<h1 class=ombre1>Shadowed title</h1>
		</div>
		<p>If you look at this wonderful demo on an old IE (or on IE10 in legacy mode) you will see a shadow. But you will also notice that the text became all pixellized, and unfortunately, there is no solution for that.</p>
		<p>Please note that "Direction" is set in degrees (for example, 0 = up, 90 = right, 180 = bottom, 270 = left) and "Strength" vaguely corresponds to the shadow's spread. (in reality, it looks more like a perspective effect...)</p>
		<p><b>And here is the "Glow" version</b></p>
		<p>CSS:</p>
		<pre style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: auto">h1 {
<br>
&nbsp; text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px #ff0000; /* Good browsers */
<br>
&nbsp; filter: glow(color=#ff0000,strength=3); zoom: 1; /* IE 6-9 */
<br>
}</pre>
		<p>HTML:</p>
		<pre>&lt;h1>Glowing title&lt;/h1></pre>
		<p>Rendu:</p>
  	<style class=hidden>.ombre2 { text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #ff0000; filter: glow(color=#ff0000,strength=1); zoom: 1; }</style>
		<div class=demo>
			<h1 class=ombre2>Glowing title</h1>
		</div>
		<p>The Glow filter mainly creates a halo around the text. But it's still quite ugly on IE. (you can have something less ugly if you don't exaggerate this much on the colours)</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Note that the filters can be combined, like the CSS3 text-shadows. It's useful, especially when we want a "text-stroke" effect.</p>
		<pre style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: auto">h1 {
<br>
&nbsp; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #ff0000, 1px -1px 1px #00ff00, -1px -1px 1px #0000ff, 1px 1px 1px #f0000f; /* Good browsers */
<br>
&nbsp; filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#ff0000', Direction=0, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#00ff00', Direction=90, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#0000ff', Direction=180, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#f0000f', Direction=270, Strength=1); zoom: 1; /* IE 6-9 */
<br>
}</pre>
		<p>HTML:</p>
		<pre>&lt;h1>Titre with many shadows&lt;/h1></pre>
		<p>Rendu:</p>
  	<style class=hidden>.ombre3 { text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #ff0000, 1px -1px 1px #00ff00, -1px -1px 1px #0000ff, 1px 1px 1px #f0000f; filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#ff0000', Direction=0, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#00ff00', Direction=90, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#0000ff', Direction=180, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#f0000f', Direction=270, Strength=1); zoom: 1;}</style>
		<div class=demo>
			<h1 class=ombre3>Titre with many shadows</h1>
		</div>
		<p>Keep in mind that it's very verbose, and very ugly on IE, when it's not used correctly.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Besides, I have an exclusive bug to show you:</p>
		<p>These browsers only work on block elements, not on inline elements.</p>
    <p>So if you need shadows on a &lt;span>, you'll have to write some nonsense like... <b>span { display: block }</b>.</p>

		<p>On ne présente plus <b>text-shadow</b>, cette propriété CSS3 permettant d'appliquer une ombre à un texte.<br>(voir: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#text-shadow" target=_blank>les specs</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/CSS/text-shadow" target=-blank>la page MDN</a>)</p>
		<p>Plusieurs navigateurs ont des petits soucis d'implémentation, mais les plus notables sont, bien évidemment, les vieux IE. Plus précisément, IE &lt; 10.</p>
		<p>Ceux-ci ont toutefois accès à des "filtres" créés par Microsoft, et qui permettant de produire un effet similaire.<br>Et parfois, on n'a pas le choix, il faut s'en servir. Voici comment faire.</p>
		<p>Deux filtres permettent de simuler des ombres: Shadow et Glow.</p>
		<p><b>Voici la version "Shadow":</b></p>
		<p>CSS:</p>
		<pre style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: auto">h1 {
<br>
&nbsp; text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px #ff0000; /* IE10+, Firefox 3.5+, Opera 9.5+, Chrome, Safari, et tous avigateurs mobiles */
<br>
&nbsp; filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#ff0000', Direction=135, Strength=3); zoom: 1; /* IE 6-9 */
<br>
}</pre>
		<p>HTML:</p>
		<pre>&lt;h1>Titre ombré&lt;/h1></pre>
		<p>Rendu:</p>
  	<style class=hidden>h1.ombre1 { text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px #ff0000; filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#ff0000', Direction=135, Strength=3); zoom: 1; }</style>
		<div class=demo>
			<h1 class=ombre1>Titre ombré</h1>
		</div>
		<p>Si vous regardez cette magnifique démo sur un vieux IE (ou sur IE10 en mode vieux IE) vous verrez bien une ombre. Mais vous verrez aussi que le texte est devenu tout pixellisé, et il n'y a hélas aucun moyen de corriger cela.</p>
		<p>Il est à noter que "Direction" s'exprime en degrés (par exemple, 0 = haut, 90 = droite, 180 = bas, 270 = gauche) et "Strength" correspond vaguement à l'étalement de l'ombre. (en réalité, ça ressemble plus à un effet de profondeur qu'à une ombre)</p>
		<p><b>Et voici la version "Glow"</b></p>
		<p>CSS:</p>
		<pre style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: auto">h1 {
<br>
&nbsp; text-shadow: 0px 0px 1px #ff0000; /* Bons navigateurs */
<br>
&nbsp; filter: glow(color=#ff0000,strength=3); zoom: 1; /* IE 6-9 */
<br>
}</pre>
		<p>HTML:</p>
		<pre>&lt;h1>Titre entouré d'ombre&lt;/h1></pre>
		<p>Rendu:</p>
  	<style class=hidden>.ombre2 { text-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #ff0000; filter: glow(color=#ff0000,strength=1); zoom: 1; }</style>
		<div class=demo>
			<h1 class=ombre2>Titre entouré d'ombre</h1>
		</div>
		<p>Le filtre Glow permet plutôt de créer un halo autour du texte. Cela dit, c'est bien moche sur IE. (oui, j'ai un peu exégéré avec mon texte en gras et mes ombres en rouge, il y a moyen de faire quelque chose qui soit... passable.)</p>
		<hr>
		<p></p>Il est à noter que les filters peuvent être additionés, tout comme les text-shadow CSS3. C'est pratique, notamment pour obtenir un effet à la "text-stroke" (pour dessiner le contour des lettres).</p>
		<pre style="white-space: nowrap; overflow: auto">h1 {
<br>
&nbsp; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #ff0000, 1px -1px 1px #00ff00, -1px -1px 1px #0000ff, 1px 1px 1px #f0000f; /* Bons navigateurs */
<br>
&nbsp; filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#ff0000', Direction=0, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#00ff00', Direction=90, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#0000ff', Direction=180, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#f0000f', Direction=270, Strength=1); zoom: 1; /* IE 6-9 */
<br>
}</pre>
		<p>HTML:</p>
		<pre>&lt;h1>Titre avec plusieurs ombres&lt;/h1></pre>
		<p>Rendu:</p>
  	<style class=hidden>.ombre3 { text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #ff0000, 1px -1px 1px #00ff00, -1px -1px 1px #0000ff, 1px 1px 1px #f0000f; filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#ff0000', Direction=0, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#00ff00', Direction=90, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#0000ff', Direction=180, Strength=1), progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow(color='#f0000f', Direction=270, Strength=1); zoom: 1;}</style>
		<div class=demo>
			<h1 class=ombre3>Titre avec plusieurs ombres</h1>
		</div>
		<p>Cela dit, c'est très verbeux, et également très moche sur IE si on s'en sert mal.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>A part ça, j'ai un petit bug bonus, en exclusivité:</p>
		<p>Ces filtres ne marchent que sur les blocs, et pas sur les éléments inline.</p>
		<p>Autrement dit, si on vous demande de mettre des ombres sur des <b>span</b>, la seule solution sera d'écrire le non-sens suivant: <b>span { display: block }</b> ... et prier pour que ça ne casse pas toute votre page...</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		A bientôt!

	<h2>Ordered and unordered lists</h2>
	<h3>august 2013</h3>
	<div id=listscontent_en>
		<p>HTML lists... we all know them by heart: they exist since the first versions of HTML and XHTML, and they almost didn't change since then. They also work on all browsers.</p>
		<p>Let's study their HTML.<br><b>&lt;ul></b> means "unordered list", <b>&lt;ol></b> means "ordered list", et <b>&lt;li></b> means "list item".<br>Here is their simplest form (note that the &lt;/li> are optionals)</p>
		<p><b>Demo:</b></p>
		<pre>&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>Element 1
  &lt;li>Element 2
  &lt;li>Element 3
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ol>
  &lt;li>Element 1
  &lt;li>Element 2
  &lt;li>Element 3
&lt;/ol></pre>
		Result:
		<div class=demo>
			<ul>
				<li>Element 1
				<li>Element 2
				<li>Element 3
			</ul>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Element 1
				<li>Element 2
				<li>Element 3
			<ol>
		</div>
		<p>The <b>li</b> can also contain <b>ul</b> or <b>ol</b> sub-lists. (but we'll talk about that later)</p>
		<p>The lists also have specific attributes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>&lt;ul></b> (and its <b>&lt;li></b>s) can have a "type" attribute, with the value "circle", "square" or "disc". This allows to change their ticks ("circle" by default).</li>
			<li><b>&lt;ol></b> (and its <b>&lt;li></b>s) can also have a "type" attribute, with values like "A", "a", "I", "i", "1". This allows to set their number notation ("1" by default).</li>
			<li>You should avoid the type attribute, and use CSS instead (we'll come to this later)</li>
			<li><b>&lt;ol></b> can have a "start" attribute telling where the numbering should begin, and its <b>&lt;li></b>s can have a "value" attribute to change their default number, and the following ones. (This works on IE6+)</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Démo:</b></p>
		<pre>&lt;ol start="10">
  &lt;li>Element 10
  &lt;li>Element 11
  &lt;li>Element 12
  &lt;li value="20">Element 20
  &lt;li>Element 21
  &lt;li>Element 22
  &lt;li value="5">Element 5
  &lt;li>Element 6
  &lt;li>Element 7
&lt;/ol></pre>
		Ce qui donne:
		<div class=demo>
			<ol start="10">
				<li>Element 10
				<li>Element 11
				<li>Element 12
				<li value="20">Element 20
				<li>Element 21
				<li>Element 22
				<li value="5">Element 5
				<li>Element 6
				<li>Element 7
			</ol>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>And finally,  <b>&lt;ol></b> can have a "reversed" attribute (appeared with HTML5) allowing to count the elements from bottom up. But since it doesn't work on IE &lt; 11, you should rather set a decreasing "value" to each <b>&lt;li></b> to get the same effect.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<p>Now let's see their default CSS code, and their dedicated CSS properties:</p>
		<p><b>&lt;ul></b> and <b>&lt;ol></b> are normal blocks (display: block). They have a default padding-left that depends on the browser (around 40px). The ticks are included in this padding and they can't be selected as normal text with the mouse.</p>
		<p><b>&lt;ul></b> has disc-shaped bullets (list-style: disc outside none).</p>
		<p><b>&lt;ol></b> has numbers in front of each element (list-style: decimal outside none).</p>
		<p><b>&lt;li></b> have a special display (display: list-item), almost identical to display: block. They also have a list-style (inherited), but they can overload it individually.</p>
		<p>
		The <b>list-style</b> property is a shorthand notation allowing to set three parameters:<br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>list-style-type</b> (that can have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/CSS/list-style-type" target=_blank>many many values</a>),</li>
			<li><b>list-style-position</b> (that can have the value "inside", "outside" or "inherit". Inside allows them to contain their own ticks, instead of letting them stay in their parent's padding.)</li>
			<li><b>list-style-image</b>, which is "none" by default, but it can also be the url of an image. If the URL is invalid (or if the image isn't fount), there is a fallback on the default list-style-type (disc, decimal, ...).</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Now let's see the different problems that lists can cause us:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&bull;
			If you apply a <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" target=_blank>CSS reset</a> to your page, it will delete the paddings on <b>ul</b> and <b>ol</b> elements, and their ticks will be hidden.
			<br>
			<b>Solution 1</b>: put the ticks inside the <b>li</b> with this rule:
			<pre>ul, ol { list-style-position: inside }</pre>
			The ticks reappear, but we still lose the indentation of nested lists.
			<br>
			<pre>&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>list
  &lt;li>list
    &lt;ol>
      &lt;li>sub-list
      &lt;li>sub-list
    &lt;/ol>
&lt;/ul></pre>
			<div class=demo>
				<ul style="list-style-position: inside; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
				<li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">list
				<li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">list
					<ol style="list-style-position: inside; margin: 0; padding: 0; display: block">
						<li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">sub-list
						<li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">sub-list
					</ol>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<b>Solution 2 (the good one)</b>: don't change the ticks position, but re-set a padding-left to the lists, like this:
			<br>
			<pre>ul, ol { padding-left: 2em }</pre>
			Result:
			<div class=demo>
				<ul>
				<li>list
				<li>list
					<ol style="display:block">
						<li>sub-list</li>
						<li>sub-list</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>
			</div>
			Indeed, the padding-left are cumulative, and so the nested lists are correctly indented. 
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp;&bull; If we nest ordered lists, their numbers will stay the same (decimal notation). A good typographic practice is to do this:
			<pre>ol { list-style-type: decimal }
ol ol { list-style: upper-alpha }
ol ol ol { list-style:  lower-roman }
ol ol ol ol { list-style: lower-alpha }</pre>
			<br>
			Which allows nested lists as pretty as this, with up to four levels:
			<div class=demo>
			<ol>
				<li>level 1</li>
				<li>item</li>
				<li>item</li>
				<li><ol>
						<li>level 2</li>
						<li>item</li>
						<li>item</li>
						<li><ol>
								<li>level 3</li>
								<li>item</li>
								<li>item</li>
								<li><ol>
										<li>level 4</li>
										<li>item</li>
										<li>item</li>
									</ol>
							</ol>
					</ol>
			</ol>
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp;&bull;
				The CSS resets generally set a vertical-align: baseline and a line-height: 1.5em to all the elements of the page, and this causes a problem on IE &lt; 8 when we have nested lists.
				<br>
				Indeed, if you watch the following list on IE &lt; 8, you will see the numbers "fall" at the bottom of the sub-lists, and the ticks will be misaligned with the text ahead.
				<br>
				<div class=demo>
				<ol>
					<li>level 1</li>
					<li>item</li>
					<li>item</li>
					<li style="vertical-align: baseline"><ol>
							<li>level 2</li>
							<li>item</li>
							<li>item</li>
							<li style="vertical-align: baseline"><ol>
									<li>level 3</li>
									<li>item</li>
									<li>item</li>
									<li style="vertical-align: baseline"><ol>
											<li>level 4</li>
											<li>item</li>
											<li>item</li>
										</ol>
								</ol>
						</ol>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>To fix the "falling" ticks, use this CSS dode:</p>
			<pre>ol, ul, li { vertical-align: top }</pre>
			<p>To fix the alignment between the ticks and the text, there is no miracle solution, but five possible approaches:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Consider that an offset of a few pixels is not a big deal on IE &lt; 8, and do nothing.</li>
				<li>Put a "1em" line-height on all the page.</li>
				<li>Let the default line-height to "1.5em", but set the &lt;li>'s line-height to "1em" and their padding to "0.25em 0", which will do the job, unless the text of the &lt,li> spreads on two lines or more, because these lines would be very close.</li>
				<li>Replace the default tick with an image that looks like a tick, but with a few pixels of vertical offset.</li>
				<li>
					Or... (and this is the solution I recommend) put an element (like a &lt;span>) in each &lt;li>, and apply this style:
					<pre>li span { *position: relative; *top: -0.5em }</pre>
					Result:
					<div class=demo>
						<ul>
							<li><span style="*position: relative; *top: -0.5em">Item 1</span></li>
							<li><span style="*position: relative; *top: -0.5em">Item 2</span></li>
							<li><span style="*position: relative; *top: -0.5em">Item 3</span></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, there is a bug on all the NEWER versions of IE (except IE6 and 7!), which you can see here:</p>
			<div class=demo>
			<ol>
				<li>level 1</li>
				<li>item</li>
				<li>item</li>
				<li><ol style="display: block">
						<li>level 2</li>
						<li>item</li>
						<li>item</li>
						<li><ol style="display: block">
								<li>level 3</li>
								<li>item</li>
								<li>item</li>
								<li><ol style="display: block">
										<li>level 4</li>
										<li>item</li>
										<li>item</li>
									</ol>
							</ol>
					</ol>
			</ol>
			</div>
			<p>Each sub-list has a huge gap on top. It's not a margin or a padding, it's an IE bug. To get rid of it, you can set float: left to the lists (but it could lead to flow issues), or put them in display: inline-block (that's what I recommend):</p>
			<pre>li ul, li ol { display: inline-block }</pre>
			<p>So, everything is correct now.</p>
			<p>Other list-related bugs and their solutions are described <a href="http://stylisticweb.com/design-tutorials/15-ie6-bugs-and-simple-solutions" target=_blank>here</a>, but I won't talk about them because they are too much specific.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Instead, let's talk about the original things that we can do with HTML lists:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A &lt;li> can live without a &lt;ol> or a &lt;ul> around it. In this case, it will have a circle-shaped tick (on all the browsers).
				</li>
				<li>
					A &lt;ul> / &lt;ol> can contain elements that are not &lt;li>. (or even some text). These elements won't have a tick or a number.
				</li>
				<li>
					There are several easy ways to display a list on many columns.<br><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/multicolumnlists" target=_blank>This article</a> is exhaustive on this subject.
				</li>
				<li>
					A list can look like a file tree with a simple 1px image and some ingenious CSS code: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/style-a-list-with-one-pixel/" target=_blank>take a look at this</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					The &lt;li> elements can use one (or many) unicode character(s) as their ticks, thanks to CSS3 (and it works on IE8+):
					<pre>li { list-style: none }
li:before { content: ">>"; margin:0 1em 0 -3em;  }</pre>
          Result:
					<style style="display: none">
					.custombullet li { list-style: none }
					.custombullet li:before { content: ">>"; margin: 0 1em 0 -3em; }
					</style>
					<div class=demo>
						<ul class=custombullet>
							<li>Item 1</li>
							<li>Item 2</li>
							<li>Item 3</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I'll stop here, and I invite you to look at <a href="//xem.github.io/Blog" target="_blank">my last project, Basis</a>: a basic "boilerplate" for HTML/CSS/JS pages, with a custom CSS reset that contains all these best practices, and many others.</p>

	<h2>Les listes ordonnées et non-ordonnées</h2>
	<h3>août 2013</h3>
	<div id=listscontent_fr>
		<p>Les listes HTML... tout le monde les connaît par coeur: elles existent depuis les toutes premières versions d'HTML et XHTML, et sont restées quasiment inchangées jusqu'à aujourd'hui. Elles fonctionnent d'ailleurs sur tous les navigateurs.</p>
		<p>Etudions tout d'abord leur HTML.<br><b>&lt;ul></b> signifie "unordered list", <b>&lt;ol></b> signifie "ordered list", et <b>&lt;li></b> signifie "list item".<br>Voici leur écriture la plus simple: (vous noterez que les &lt;/li> sont optionnels)</p>
		<p><b>Démo:</b></p>
		<pre>&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>Element 1
  &lt;li>Element 2
  &lt;li>Element 3
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ol>
  &lt;li>Element 1
  &lt;li>Element 2
  &lt;li>Element 3
&lt;/ol></pre>
		Ce qui donne:
		<div class=demo>
			<ul>
				<li>Element 1
				<li>Element 2
				<li>Element 3
			</ul>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Element 1
				<li>Element 2
				<li>Element 3
			<ol>
		</div>
		<p>Les <b>li</b> peuvent à leur tour contenir des sous-listes <b>ul</b> ou <b>ol</b>. (mais nous en reparlerons plus tard)</p>
		<p>Les listes ont également des attributs spécifiques:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>L'<b>&lt;ul></b> (et ses <b>&lt;li></b>) peuvent avoir un attribut type, ayant comme valeur "circle", "square" ou "disc". Cela permet de changer leurs puces (par défaut à "circle").</li>
			<li>L'<b>&lt;ol></b> (et ses <b>&lt;li></b>) peuvent aussi avoir un attribut type, ayant comme valeur "A", "a", "I", "i", "1". Cela permet de changer leurs numérotations (par défaut à "1").</li>
			<li>L'attribut type est toutefois à éviter, il vaut mieux faire ces modifications avec du CSS. (on va en reparler)</li>
			<li>L'<b>&lt;ol></b> peut avoir un attribut "start" disant où doit commencer la numérotation, et ses <b>&lt;li></b> peuvent avoir un attribut "value" changeant le numéro de l'élément courant, et de ceux qui suivent. (et c'est compatible IE6+)</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Démo:</b></p>
		<pre>&lt;ol start="10">
  &lt;li>Element 10
  &lt;li>Element 11
  &lt;li>Element 12
  &lt;li value="20">Element 20
  &lt;li>Element 21
  &lt;li>Element 22
  &lt;li value="5">Element 5
  &lt;li>Element 6
  &lt;li>Element 7
&lt;/ol></pre>
		Ce qui donne:
		<div class=demo>
			<ol start="10">
				<li>Element 10
				<li>Element 11
				<li>Element 12
				<li value="20">Element 20
				<li>Element 21
				<li>Element 22
				<li value="5">Element 5
				<li>Element 6
				<li>Element 7
			</ol>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Et enfin, <b>&lt;ol></b> peut avoir un attribut "reversed" (apparu en HTML5) servant à compter à l'envers (de bas en haut). Mais vu qu'il ne fonctionne pas sur IE &lt; 11, il est préférable de mettre directement des "value" décroissantes à chaque <b>&lt;li></b> pour obtenir cet effet.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<p>Voyons maintenant leur code CSS par défaut, et les propriétés CSS qui leurs sont dédiées:</p>
		<p><b>&lt;ul></b> et <b>&lt;ol></b> sont des blocs classiques (display: block). Ils ont un padding-left qui varie selon les navigateurs (environ 40px). Les puces sont incluses dans ce padding et ne peuvent pas être sélectionnées à la souris, en tant que texte.</p>
		<p>L'<b>&lt;ul></b> a des puces en forme de disque (list-style: disc outside none).</p>
		<p>L'<b>&lt;ol></b> a des numéros en face de chaque élément (list-style: decimal outside none).</p>
		<p>Les <b>&lt;li></b> ont un affichage particulier (display: list-item), quasiment identique à du display: block. Ils ont également un list-style hérité de leur parent, mais qui peut être surchargé individuellement.</p>
		<p>
		La propriété CSS <b>list-style</b> est une écriture shorthand qui peut être utilisée pour fixer trois paramètres:<br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>list-style-type</b> (pouvant avoir <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/CSS/list-style-type" target=_blank>une multitude de valeurs</a>),</li>
			<li><b>list-style-position</b> (qui peut avoir comme valeur "inside", "outside" et "inherit", inside leur permettant de contenir leurs puces, au lieu de les laisser dans le padding du parent.)</li>
			<li><b>list-style-image</b>, qui est par défaut à "none", mais qu'on peut remplacer par l'url d'une image. Si l'URL est invalide (ou si l'image est absente), c'est le list-style-type (disque, décimal, ...) qui sera utilisé comme fallback.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Voyons maintenant les différents problèmes que les listes peuvent nous poser:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&bull;
			Si vous appliquez un <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" target=_blank>CSS reset</a> à votre page, celui-ci va supprimer les paddings des <b>ul</b> et des <b>ol</b>, ce qui cachera leurs puces.
			<br>
			<b>Solution 1</b>: mettre les puces dans les <b>li</b> grâce à cette règle:
			<pre>ul, ol { list-style-position: inside }</pre>
			Les puces réapparaissent, mais on perd l'indentation des listes imbriquées.
			<br>
			<pre>&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>liste
  &lt;li>liste
    &lt;ol>
      &lt;li>sous-liste
      &lt;li>sous-liste
    &lt;/ol>
&lt;/ul></pre>
			<div class=demo>
				<ul style="list-style-position: inside; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
				<li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">liste
				<li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">liste
					<ol style="list-style-position: inside; margin: 0; padding: 0; display: block">
						<li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">sous-liste
						<li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">sous-liste
					</ol>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<b>Solution 2 (la bonne)</b>: ne pas toucher à la position des puces, mais remettre un padding-left aux listes, comme ceci:
			<br>
			<pre>ul, ol { padding-left: 2em }</pre>
			Ce qui donne:
			<div class=demo>
				<ul>
				<li>liste
				<li>liste
					<ol style="display:block">
						<li>sous-liste</li>
						<li>sous-liste</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>
			</div>
			En effet, les padding-left s'additionnent, ce qui permet à la sous-liste d'être plus indentée que sa liste parente. 
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp;&bull; Si on imbrique plusieurs listes ordonnées, leurs numérotations seront identiques (notation décimale). Une bonne pratique typographique consiste à faire ceci:
			<pre>ol { list-style-type: decimal }
ol ol { list-style: upper-alpha }
ol ol ol { list-style:  lower-roman }
ol ol ol ol { list-style: lower-alpha }</pre>
			<br>
			Ce qui permet d'avoir des listes imbriquées aussi jolies que ceci, quand quatre listes ordonnées sont imbriquées:
			<div class=demo>
			<ol>
				<li>level 1</li>
				<li>item</li>
				<li>item</li>
				<li><ol>
						<li>level 2</li>
						<li>item</li>
						<li>item</li>
						<li><ol>
								<li>level 3</li>
								<li>item</li>
								<li>item</li>
								<li><ol>
										<li>level 4</li>
										<li>item</li>
										<li>item</li>
									</ol>
							</ol>
					</ol>
			</ol>
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp;&bull;
				Les CSS resets mettent généralement un vertical-align: baseline et un line-height: 1.5em à tous les éléments de la page, et ça pose problème sur IE &lt; 8 dans le cas où on a des listes imbriquées.
				<br>
				En effet, en regardant la liste suivante sur IE &lt; 8, vous verrez les numéros "tomber" tout en bas des sous-listes, et les puces seront mal alignées avec les textes en face.
				<br>
				<div class=demo>
				<ol>
					<li>level 1</li>
					<li>item</li>
					<li>item</li>
					<li style="vertical-align: baseline"><ol>
							<li>level 2</li>
							<li>item</li>
							<li>item</li>
							<li style="vertical-align: baseline"><ol>
									<li>level 3</li>
									<li>item</li>
									<li>item</li>
									<li style="vertical-align: baseline"><ol>
											<li>level 4</li>
											<li>item</li>
											<li>item</li>
										</ol>
								</ol>
						</ol>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>Pour corriger les puces qui "tombent", utilisez ce CSS:</p>
			<pre>ol, ul, li { vertical-align: top }</pre>
			<p>Pour corriger l'alignement entre les puces et le texte, il n'y a pas de solution miracle, mais cinq approches possibles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Soit considérer que quelques pixels de décalage sur IE &lt; 8, c'est pas grave, et ne rien faire.</li>
				<li>Soit mettre un line-height à "1em" sur toute la page.</li>
				<li>Soit laisser le line-height par défaut à "1.5em", mais mettre le line-height des &lt;li> à "1em" et leur padding à "0.25em 0", ce qui fera quasiment le même effet qu'un line-height: 1.5em, l'inconvénient étant que si le texte d'un &lt;li> s'étale sur deux lignes, ces lignes seront très collées.</li>
				<li>Soit remplacer la puce par une image qui a l'apparence d'une puce, mais décalée de quelques pixels vers le bas.</li>
				<li>
					Soit (et c'est la solution que je préconise) mettre un élément (par exemple &lt;span>) dans chaque &lt;li>, et appliquer ce style:
					<pre>li span { *position: relative; *top: -0.5em }</pre>
					Ce qui donne:
					<div class=demo>
						<ul>
							<li><span style="*position: relative; *top: -0.5em">Item 1</span></li>
							<li><span style="*position: relative; *top: -0.5em">Item 2</span></li>
							<li><span style="*position: relative; *top: -0.5em">Item 3</span></li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Il y a par contre un bug présent sur tous les derniers IE parus (sauf IE6 et 7!), et que vous pouvez observer ici:</p>
			<div class=demo>
			<ol>
				<li>level 1</li>
				<li>item</li>
				<li>item</li>
				<li><ol style="display: block">
						<li>level 2</li>
						<li>item</li>
						<li>item</li>
						<li><ol style="display: block">
								<li>level 3</li>
								<li>item</li>
								<li>item</li>
								<li><ol style="display: block">
										<li>level 4</li>
										<li>item</li>
										<li>item</li>
									</ol>
							</ol>
					</ol>
			</ol>
			</div>
			<p>Chaque sous-liste est décalée vers le bas. Ce n'est pas une marge ni un padding, c'est un bug d'IE. Pour s'en débarasser, vous pouvez soit mettre les sous-listes en float:left (ce qui pose des problèmes de flot), soit (et c'est la bonne solution) les mettre en inline-block:</p>
			<pre>li ul, li ol { display: inline-block }</pre>
			<p>Avec ça, tout rentre dans l'ordre.</p>
			<p>D'autres bugs IE6/7 relatfs aux listes, et leurs solutions, sont détaillés <a href="http://stylisticweb.com/design-tutorials/15-ie6-bugs-and-simple-solutions" target=_blank>ici</a>, mais je n'en parlerai pas car ils apparaissent dans des cas trop spécifiques.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Parlons plutôt des choses originales qu'on peut faire avec des listes HTML:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Un &lt;li> peut ne pas avoir d'&lt;ol> ou d'&lt;ul> autour. Il sera alors précédé d'un cercle (et ce, sur tous les navigateurs).
				</li>
				<li>
					Un &lt;ul> / &lt;ol> peut contenir autre choses que des &lt;li>. (des éléments HTML ou du texte). Ceux-ci seront dénués de puces ou de numéros.
				</li>
				<li>
					Il existe des moyens simples pour faire en sorte qu'une liste s'affiche sur plusieurs colonnes.<br><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/multicolumnlists" target=_blank>Cet article</a> traite ce sujet de façon exhaustive.
				</li>
				<li>
					Une liste peut ressembler à une arborescence avec une image de 1px et du CSS ingénieux: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/style-a-list-with-one-pixel/" target=_blank>voyez plutôt</a>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Les &lt;li> peuvent avoir des caractères unicode comme puces, grâce au CSS3 (et ça marche sur IE8+):
					<pre>li { list-style: none }
li:before { content: ">>"; margin:0 1em 0 -3em;  }</pre>
				Ce qui donne:
					<style style="display: none">
					.custombullet li { list-style: none }
					.custombullet li:before { content: ">>"; margin: 0 1em 0 -3em; }
					</style>
					<div class=demo>
						<ul class=custombullet>
							<li>Item 1</li>
							<li>Item 2</li>
							<li>Item 3</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sur ce, je m'arrête là, et je vous invite à jeter un oeil à <a href="//xem.github.io/Blog" target="_blank">mon dernier projet, Basis</a>: un point de départ (ou "boilerplate", comme on dit outre-France) pour faire des pages HTML/CSS/JS, avec un CSS reset maison qui inclut toutes ces techniques pour bien gérer les listes (imbriquées) sur tous les navigateurs.</p>

	<h2>The HTML5 contenteditable attribute</h2>
	<h3>july 2013</h3>
	<div id=contenteditablecontent_en>
		<p>The <b>contenteditable</b> attribute makes any HTML element editable with the mouse and/or the keyboard.</p>
		<p>
		This attribute is one of the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/global-attributes.html">HTML5 global attributes</a>, so it can be applied to all HTML5 elements.
		<br>
		It's also one of those features that existed in browsers for a long time before W3C standardization.
		<br>
		Indeed, <a href="http://caniuse.com/contenteditable">we can use this attribute</a> on browser as old as IE 5 and Firefox 3! Microsoft created it, by the way.
		</p>
		<p>
		It's easy to use: like <b>id</b> or <b>class</b>, you can use <b>contenteditable="true"</b> on any element, or simply <b>contenteditable</b>.
		<br>
		Note that this attribute is inherited by default. So the value <b>contenteditable="inherit"</b> is completely useless (but it exists).
		<br>
		However, if you want to make an element editable, but not its children, these children must have <b>contenteditable="false"</b>.
		</p>
		<p contenteditable><b>Example:</b> click on this paragraph to edit the text inside.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Here's the list of crazy facts about <b>contenteditable</b>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Like we saw earlier, we can make an element non-editable if its parent is editable. The non-editable element can still be selected, moved and deleted.
				<p contenteditable><b>Example:</b> In this editable paragraph, <b contenteditable="false">this text in bold</b> can't be edited, but you can move and delete it with the mouse.</p>
				On Firefox, we can't move text from an editable container to another editable container... that's a bug.
			</li>
			<li>
				Firefox allows to resize images that have or inherit the <b>contenteditable</b> behavior.<br><br>
				<b>Example:</b><br>
				<p contenteditable> Click on this image <img src="http://placehold.it/200x50" style="vertical-align: middle"> to resize it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				Any HTML code can be inserted in an editable element
				<div contenteditable><b>Example:</b> You can copy-paste here<br><br>- The content of another Webpage:<br><br><br><br>- The content of a Word / Excel document:<br><br><br><br></div>
			</li>
			<li>
				Thanks to this attribute, we can make complete WYSIWYG editors, like <a href="http://ckeditor.com/demo#full">CKEditor</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can also access to a quick notepad by typing <b>data:text/html, &lt;html contenteditable></b> in the address bar of your browser (or by clicking <a href="data:text/html, <html contenteditable>" target="_blank">here</a>).
				This trick comes from <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq">Jose Jesus Perez Aguinaga</a>.
				You can find many variations of this notepad <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5135194" target="_blank">here</a>. 
			</li>
			<li>If you make a <b>style</b> element visible and editable, this can make a crazy auto-recursive editor, in which you can edit in real time the style of the block you're writing into.<br>Try it:<br>
				<style spellcheck="false" contenteditable>style[contenteditable] {
	display: block;          /* make <style> blocks visible */
	white-space: pre;        /* presentation */
	font-family: monospace;  /* typography */
	background: #ddeeff;     /* background color */
	color: #112233;          /* text color */
}</style>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>script</b> elements can also be visible and editable (here's an exemple). However, the JavaScript code isn't executed when you edit it. It's a simple text block.<br>
				<script contenteditable>console.log("Log unique");</script>
				<br>
				(open your F12 console to see this message)
				<br>
				But JavaScript itself allows to detect changes happening in a <b>script</b> element and execute its content.<br>
				Warning: don't do this at home (XSS attacks can occur). This example is only a proof of concept.<br> 
				<script id="js" contenteditable>// This block has the id "js".
var js = document.getElementById("js");
js.onkeyup = function(){
	eval(js.innerText);
}
console.log("Log at each edition");</script>
				<br>
				This works fine on Chrome and IE 10. Sadly, Firefox and IE9 can't listen to keystrokes events on <b>script</b> elements... But you can replace them with textareas, which are natively editable.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		Cheers!

	<h2>L'attribut contenteditable en HTML5</h2>
	<h3>juillet 2013</h3>
	<div id=contenteditablecontent_fr>
		<p>L'attribut <b>contenteditable</b> permet de rendre le contenu de n'importe quel élément HTML éditable avec le clavier et/ou la souris.</p>
		<p>
		Cet attribut fait partie des <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/global-attributes.html">attributs globaux HTML5</a>, ce qui signifie qu'il peut potentiellement être appliqué à tous les éléments HTML5.
		<br>
		Il fait également partie de ces fonctionnalités qui ont existé dans les navigateurs bien avant d'avoir été standardisées par le W3C.
		<br>
		En effet, <a href="http://caniuse.com/contenteditable">on retrouve cet attribut</a> sur des navigateurs aussi anciens qu'IE 5 et Firefox 3! C'est d'ailleurs Microsoft qui l'a créé.
		</p>
		<p>
		Pour l'utiliser, rien de plus simple: tout comme vous pouvez appliquer un attribut <b>id</b> ou <b>class</b> à un élément HTML, vous pouvez utiliser <b>contenteditable="true"</b>, ou tout simplement <b>contenteditable</b>.
		<br>
		Il est à noter que cet attribut est hérité par défaut. La valeur <b>contenteditable="inherit"</b> est donc complètement inutile.
		<br>
		Par contre, si vous voulez rendre un élément éditable mais pas ses descendants, ceux-ci doivent avoir <b>contenteditable="false"</b>.
		</p>
		<p contenteditable><b>Exemple:</b> cliquer sur ce paragraphe pour éditer le texte qui s'y trouve.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Voici maintenant la liste des trucs dingues concernant <b>contenteditable</b>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Comme on l'a vu plus haut, on peut rendre un élément non éditable alors que son parent est éditable. L'élément non éditable pourra toutefois être sélectionné, déplacé et supprimé.
				<p contenteditable><b>Exemple:</b> Dans ce paragraphe éditable, on ne peut pas éditer <b contenteditable="false">ce texte en gras</b> mais on peut le supprimer et le déplacer à l'aide de la souris.</p>
				Sur Firefox, on ne peut pas déplacer du texte d'un bloc éditable à un autre bloc éditable. C'est un bug.
			</li>
			<li>
				Firefox permet de redimensionner les images qui ont l'attribut <b>contenteditable</b> (ou qui en héritent)<br><br>
				<b>Exemple:</b><br>
				<p contenteditable> Cliquez sur cette image <img src="http://placehold.it/200x50" style="vertical-align: middle"> pour la redimensionner.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				On peut insérer n'importe quel code HTML dans un élément éditable
				<div contenteditable><b>Exemple:</b> copiez-collez ci-dessous<br><br>- Le contenu d'une autre page Web:<br><br><br><br>- Le contenu d'un document Word ou Excel:<br><br><br><br></div>
			</li>
			<li>
				Grâce à cet attribut, on peut faire des éditeurs WYSIWYG ultra-complets, comme <a href="http://ckeditor.com/demo#full">CKEditor</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				On peut aussi avoir accès à un bloc-notes d'appoint en tapant <b>data:text/html, &lt;html contenteditable></b> dans la barre d'adresse de son navigateur (ou en cliquant <a href="data:text/html, <html contenteditable>" target="_blank">ici</a>).
				On doit cette astuce à <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq">Jose Jesus Perez Aguinaga</a>.
				Vous trouverez <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5135194" target="_blank">ici</a> de nombreuses variations de ce bloc-botes. 
			</li>
			<li>Rendre un élément <b>style</b> visible et éditable peut mener à un éditeur auto-récursif assez dingue, étant donné que vous pouvez editer en direct le style du bloc dans lequel vous écrivez.<br>Essayez ci-dessous:<br>
				<style spellcheck="false" contenteditable>#contenteditable_fr style[contenteditable] {
	display: block;          /* rendre vidible les blocs <style> */
	white-space: pre;        /* présentation */
	font-family: monospace;  /* typographie */
	background: #ddeeff;     /* couleur de fond */
	color: #112233;          /* couleur de texte */
}</style>
			</li>
			<li>
				On peut aussi rendre les éléments <b>script</b> visibles et éditables (en voici un exemple). Toutefois, le code JavaScript n'est pas réexécuté automatiquement à chaque modification.<br>
				<script contenteditable>console.log("Log unique");</script>
				<br>
				(ouvrez votre console F12 pour voir ce message)
				<br>
				Mais JavaScript, justement, permet de détecter les changements qui ont lieu dans un élément <b>script</b> et exécuter son contenu.<br>
				Attention toutefois, évaluer du code JS venant de vos visiteurs peut être dangereux. L'exemple qui suit n'est qu'un proof of concept!<br> 
				<script id="js" contenteditable>// Ce bloc script a l'id "js".
var js = document.getElementById("js");
js.onkeyup = function(){
	eval(js.innerText);
}
console.log("Log à chaque modification");</script>
				<br>
				Cela fonctionne très bien sur Chrome et IE 10. Firefox et IE9 sont hélas capricieux et il est compliqué de leur faire exécuter du code JS à chaque modification d'un élément <b>script</b>... A vrai dire, je ne suis même pas sûr que ça soit possible. Faute de mieux, on peut continuer à utiliser des textarea, qui sont nativement éditables et envoient les bons événements.
			</li>
		</ul>

		A bientôt!

	<h2>The HTML5 Doctype</h2>
	<h3>june 2013</h3>
  coming soon
	<!--div id=doctype>
		<p>Le doctype n'est pas un élément HTML comme les autres, c'est un préambule qui sert à dire au navigateur comment il doit afficher le reste de la page.</p>
		<p>Ce préambule existe depuis HTML2 et XHTML1. Toutefois, jusqu'à l'apparition d'HTML5, les doctypes étaient de très longues chaînes impossibles à mémoriser par coeur, et pour peu qu'on fasse une faute de frappe, les navigateurs pouvaient mal le prendre, en particulier IE qui applique des règles d'affichage ancestrales (qu'on appelle aussi "mode quirks") en cas de doctype absent ou invalide.</p>
		<p>Bref: ce qu'il faut retenir, c'est que maintenant, le doctype s'écrit comme ceci: <b>&lt;!doctype html></b>, et qu'il doit être placé tout au début du document HTML. Il est suivi de l'élément racine, à savoir <b>&lt;html></b>.</p>
		</p>Oui mais comment on fait du XHTML5 alors? La réponse est simple: ça n'existe pas. Il n'y a qu'un HTML5, et il n'est ni "X" ni "strict" ni "transitional". et ça ne l'empêche pas de bien marcher, même sur les IE préhistoriques.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Voici maintenant la liste tant attendue des trucs de ouf concernant <b>le doctype HTML5</b>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Le <b>doctype</b> est insensible à la casse et peut contenir plusieurs espaces avant et après le mot "html". Vous pouvez donc l'écrire <b>&lt;!DoCtYpE &nbsp; &nbsp; HtMl &nbsp; ></b> si ça vous chante.</li>
			<li>Le <b>doctype</b> HTML5 peut contenir <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#the-doctype" target="_blank">d'autres informations</a>, mais aucune n'est utile quand on écrit son HTML à la main ou avec un IDE moderne.
			<li>
				Le <b>doctype</b> et l'élément <b>title</b> sont les deux seuls éléments obligatoires dans un document HTML5 valide.
				<br>
				Voici le plus petit valide document HTML5:
				<pre>&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;title>&lt;/title></pre>
			</li>
			<li>
				Le doctype ne peut pas être lu, ni modifié en JavaScript, mais on peut tout de même savoir si le navigateur est en mode quirks ou en mode compatibilité comme ceci:
				<pre>if(document.compatMode === 'CSS1Compat'){
	// On est pas en mode quirks!
}
if(document.compatMode === 'BackCompat'){
	// On est en mode compatibilité!
}</pre>
				<button onclick="alert(document.compatMode!=='CSS1Compat')">Est-on en mode quirks?</button>
				<button onclick="alert(document.compatMode!=='BackCompat')">Est-on en mode compatibilité?</button> (si les deux sont "false", tout va bien)
			</li>
			<li>A propos du "mode compatibilité", qui pousse IE7, IE8, IE9 et IE10 à afficher les pages Web avec le moteur de rendu de leur prédécésseur (E6, IE7, IE8 et IE9, respectivement), de nombreuses raisons font que ce mode s'active sur IE, mais le plus souvent, c'est dû au fait qu'on visionne une page HTML qui se trouve sur son PC, ou sur un réseau local. Pour éviter ce désagrément, ouvrez IE, faites "alt" pour que le menu du haut apparaisse, allez sur "outils > paramètres d'affichage de compatibilité" et décochez "Afficher les sites intranet dans Affichage de compatibilité". Faites "OK" et redémarrez IE. C'est réglé!</li>
			<li>
				Sur IE < 9, le <b>doctype</b>, du fait qu'il commence par un <b>!</b>, est considéré comme un <b>commentaire HTML</b>. En voici la preuve:
				<pre>// Récupérons le nom du premier élément HTML de cette page dans le DOM
var premier_element = document.getElementsByTagName("*")[0].tagName;</pre>
				<button onclick="alert(document.getElementsByTagName('*')[0].tagName)">Quel est le nom du premier élément du DOM?</button> ("!" sur IE < 9, "HTML" ailleurs)
				<br>
				<br>
				(Les IE < 9 sont d'ailleurs les seuls navigateurs à inclure les commentaires (sauf les commentaires conditionnels) dans <b>document.getElementsByTagName("*")</b>, comme décrit <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2009/02/20things-you-should-know-when-not-using-a-js-library/" target="_blank">ici</a>)
			</li>
			<li>
				Le <b>doctype</b> HTML5 fait apparaitre de vilaines scrollbars autour des <b>iframes</b> sur IE6, pour <a href="http://inmyexperience.com/2003/01/iframe-and-doctype-follies.html" target="_blank">d'obscures raisons</a>, alors que les doctypes d'avant HTML4 ne le faisaient pas. Le seul moyen de les faire disparaître est d'utiliser l'attribut (hélas non standard) <b>scrolling=no</b> sur vos iframes... si vous voulez supporter IE6, bien sûr, ce que je ne vous conseille pas de faire.</li>
				Démo: iframe normale<br>
				<iframe style="width: 200px; height: 40px; border: 1px solid black;"></iframe>
				<br><br>iframe sans scrollbars sur IE6<br>
				<iframe style="width: 200px; height: 40px; border: 1px solid black;" scrolling=no></iframe>
			</li>
			<li>Il y a un autre bug sur IE, y compris IE10 (et peut-être IE11, à confirmer): si votre page est en mode quirks, et qu'elle contient des <b>iframe</b> qui ont un doctype valide, ces <b>iframe</b> s'afficheront tout de même en mode quirks!
		</ul>

		A bientôt!

if(document.compatMode === 'BackCompat'){
	// On est en mode compatibilité!
}</pre>
				<button onclick="alert(document.compatMode!=='CSS1Compat')">Est-on en mode quirks?</button>
				<button onclick="alert(document.compatMode!=='BackCompat')">Est-on en mode compatibilité?</button> (si les deux sont "false", tout va bien)
			</li>
			<li>A propos du "mode compatibilité", qui pousse IE7, IE8, IE9 et IE10 à afficher les pages Web avec le moteur de rendu de leur prédécésseur (E6, IE7, IE8 et IE9, respectivement), de nombreuses raisons font que ce mode s'active sur IE, mais le plus souvent, c'est dû au fait qu'on visionne une page HTML qui se trouve sur son PC, ou sur un réseau local. Pour éviter ce désagrément, ouvrez IE, faites "alt" pour que le menu du haut apparaisse, allez sur "outils > paramètres d'affichage de compatibilité" et décochez "Afficher les sites intranet dans Affichage de compatibilité". Faites "OK" et redémarrez IE. C'est réglé!</li>
			<li>
				Sur IE < 9, le <b>doctype</b>, du fait qu'il commence par un <b>!</b>, est considéré comme un <b>commentaire HTML</b>. En voici la preuve:
				<pre>// Récupérons le nom du premier élément HTML de cette page dans le DOM
var premier_element = document.getElementsByTagName("*")[0].tagName;</pre>
				<button onclick="alert(document.getElementsByTagName('*')[0].tagName)">Quel est le nom du premier élément du DOM?</button> ("!" sur IE < 9, "HTML" ailleurs)
				<br>
				<br>
				(Les IE < 9 sont d'ailleurs les seuls navigateurs à inclure les commentaires (sauf les commentaires conditionnels) dans <b>document.getElementsByTagName("*")</b>, comme décrit <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2009/02/20things-you-should-know-when-not-using-a-js-library/" target="_blank">ici</a>)
			</li>
			<li>
				Le <b>doctype</b> HTML5 fait apparaitre de vilaines scrollbars autour des <b>iframes</b> sur IE6, pour <a href="http://inmyexperience.com/2003/01/iframe-and-doctype-follies.html" target="_blank">d'obscures raisons</a>, alors que les doctypes d'avant HTML4 ne le faisaient pas. Le seul moyen de les faire disparaître est d'utiliser l'attribut (hélas non standard) <b>scrolling=no</b> sur vos iframes... si vous voulez supporter IE6, bien sûr, ce que je ne vous conseille pas de faire.</li>
				Démo: iframe normale<br>
				<iframe style="width: 200px; height: 40px; border: 1px solid black;"></iframe>
				<br><br>iframe sans scrollbars sur IE6<br>
				<iframe style="width: 200px; height: 40px; border: 1px solid black;" scrolling=no></iframe>
			</li>
			<li>Il y a un autre bug sur IE, y compris IE10 (et peut-être IE11, à confirmer): si votre page est en mode quirks, et qu'elle contient des <b>iframe</b> qui ont un doctype valide, ces <b>iframe</b> s'afficheront tout de même en mode quirks!
