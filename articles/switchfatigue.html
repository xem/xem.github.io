  <h2>Switch homebrew installation fatigue</h2>
  <h3>November 2021 - August 2024</h3>
  <p><mark style="padding:5px">Disclaimer: I do not condone piracy. This page only talks about legal stuff you can do with your console.</mark>

  <p>Sigh. It's so complex to find accurate, complete and up-to-date information to install stuff on Switch.
  <br>I did my own research and summarized it here:
  <br><br><h3>Hardware:</h3>
  <br>You need a <a href="https://ismyswitchpatched.com/">hackable Switch</a> kept on the lowest possible firmware, an empty microSD card >= 64GB formatted in exFAT (or FAT32 if you don't care about files bigger than 4GB... but I recommend ExFAT), and a way to boot in RCM mode (SX Pro or <a href="https://fr.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20211101235930&SearchText=switch+jig+rcm">jig + dongle</a>).
  
  <br><br><h3>The very first time you hack your Switch:</h3>
  <br>Go into <b>Plane Mode</b> to avoid bans, and copy / extract the following items at the root of an SD card:
  <br>- <a href="https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases">Hekate</a>
  <br>- <a href="https://hackintendo.com/download/sigpatches/">Sigpatches</a>
  <br>- <a href="https://github.com/switchbrew/nx-hbmenu/releases">Hbmenu</a>
  <br>- <details style="display:inline;background:#ccc;width:calc(100% - 100px);vertical-align:top"><summary>Create an <b>EmuMMC</b> (emulated internal memory, a.k.a emuNAND. Click for details)</summary> Insert the jig and dongle in your Switch, boot it whille pressing the "volume +" button, and open Hekate. Go to Tools > Partition SD card > OK > 29GB emuMMC > Next step > Start. When it's done, go to Home > emuMMC > create emuMMC > SD partition > Part 1. When it's done, tap "close" and launch the emuMMC. (screenshots available on <a href="https://switch.homebrew.guide/emummc/emummc.html">this page</a>). Atmosphere will boot. 
  </details>
  <br>- You can now install homebrews on your SD card (and access them through the photo gallery app), and upgrade virtual firmware any time.
  
  
  <br><br><h3>To upgrade your virtual firmware and homebrews (up to june 2024):</h3>
  <br>Delete existing /atmosphere and /bootoader folders from your SD card,<br>then download and put following items at the root of your SD card, in this order:
  <br>- <a href="https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases">Hekate</a>
  <br>- <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases/">Atmosphere</a>
  <br>- <a href="https://darthsternie.net/switch-firmwares/">Globa Firmware</a> (use the latest that is supported by Atmosphere, check the <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases">release notes</a> to be sure)
  <br>- <a href="https://hackintendo.com/download/sigpatches/">Sigpatches</a>
  <br>- <a href="https://github.com/switchbrew/nx-hbmenu/releases">Hbmenu</a>
  <br>- <a href="https://tinfoil.io/Download">Tinfoil</a> (NRO or NSP version)
  <br>- Any other homebrew or content you want to upgrade or install
  <br>- Run the DayBreak homebrew to install the new firmware. (Choose the options "Preserve settings" and "Fat + ExFat").
  
  <br><br><h3>June 2023 update</h3>
  <br><br>Since june 2024, fusée, tinfoil, atmosphere 1.7.1, FW 1.8.1 and hbmenu aren't compatible with each other anymore, god damn it. 
  <br><b>The current fix consists in using <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/sigpatches-for-atmosphere-hekate-fss0-fusee-package3.571543/page-172#post-10437379">a hacked fusee.bin</a> and <a href="https://gbatemp.net/download/sys-patch-1-5-2-binary-fw-18-1-0-atmosphere-1-7-1.38686/">these sys patches</a>.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  PS: <a href="https://www.sdsetup.com/console?switch">sdsetup</a> is not maintained anymore, and doesn't support firmwares > 16.0. You can still use it to get interesting homebrews.
  <br><br>PS: Tinfoil requires a password to enable unsigned code installation, the password is: "up up down down left right left right B A +" (but take care to not install anything malicious).

<p>Cheers,
