  <h2>Switch hacking fatigue</h2>
  <h3>November 2021</h3>
  <p><mark style="padding:5px">Disclaimer: I do not condone piracy. This page only talks about legal stuff you can do with your console.</mark>

  <p>Sigh. I spent a whole evening hacking my switch, as usual, because of the terrible documentation and explanations online.
  <br>Very good guides exist, but unfortunately, they only explain half of the stuff we need, and must be completed by doing dozens of Google searches and skimming many forum posts to gather the whole picture...
  
  <p>But running homebrews, backing up/modding your cartridges, installing a custom firmware... were quite easy when Team Xecuter still existed. But they closed years ago, abandoning support for the most recent Switch firmwares.
  <p>So I finally decided to jump to the open-source alternatives, and here's a summary if you ever want to do it too without tearing your hair off:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Hardware:</b> you need a <a href="https://ismyswitchpatched.com/">hackable Switch</a> kept on the lowest possible firmware, an empty microSD card >= 64GB formatted in exFAT (or FAT32 if you don't care about files bigger than 4GB... but I recommend ExFAT), and a SX Pro (or any <a href="https://fr.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20211101235930&SearchText=switch+jig+rcm">jig + dongle</a> you want. It's also doable with a paperclip + a PC and a USB cable but it's much less convenient).
  <li><b>SD setup:</b> download the recommended setup <a href="https://www.sdsetup.com/console?switch">here</a>, put the contents of the "sd" folder + the content of the "payloads" folder at the root of your SD card. Download the latest firmwre supported by Atmosphere <a href="https://darthsternie.net/switch-firmwares/">here</a> (the supported firmwares are listed in Atmosphere's <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases">release notes</a>) and unzip it at the root of the SD card. Download <a href="https://tinfoil.io/Download">Tinfoil</a>'s NRO installer and put it at the root of the SD card. If you have an activated SX pro, copy your boot.dat + license files at the root of your SD card. If you want to back up and restore your own cartridges, you'll also need to download these Atmosphere's <a href="https://hackintendo.com/download/sigpatches-atmosphere-esfsloader/">patches</a> and copy the two folders inside the zip at the root of your SD card. Do NOT put anything else on the SD card yet.
  <li><b>EmuMMC:</b> this is a virtual internal memory where you can install a custom firmware, also known as emuNAND. insert the jig and the dongle in your Switch, boot it whille pressing the "volume +" button, and open Hekate. Go to Tools > Partition SD card > OK > 29GB emuMMC > Next step > Start. When it's done, go to Home > emuMMC > create emuMMC > SD partition > Part 1. When it's done, tap "close" and launch the emuMMC. (screenshots available on <a href="https://switch.homebrew.guide/emummc/emummc.html">this page</a>). Atmosphere will boot. You can access the homebrews by opening the photo gallery. You can check the emuMMC firmware version bu opening System Settings > system > system update. (The "E" at the end stands for "Emulated")
  <li><b>Plane mode</b>: disable Wi-fi to avoid bans.
  <li><b>Firmware update</b>: let's put our emuMMC to the latest version. Go to Photo gallery > Daybreak > choose the firmware folder > Continue > Preserve settings > Install (FAT + exFAT).
  <li><b>All that you want</b>: put homebrews or anything you want on your SD card, then you can launch NRO files from the photo gallery or install NSPs via the Tinfoil app (which is also in your photo gallery). Tinfoil requires a password to enable unsigned code installation, the password is: "up up down down left right left right B A +"
  <li><b>Troubleshooting SX pro</b>: when using SX PRO to boot Atmosphere, it says an error occurred, just press "Power" and it should boot normally.
  <li><b>Troubleshooting corruptions</b>: Tinfoil may crash while installing a NSP. The worst that can happen is that it corrupts the NSP and/or itself on the SD card. In that case, replace the tinfoil and nsp files on the SD card with correct ones and try again.
</ul>
<p>Cheers,
