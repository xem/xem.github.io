<h2>2KPlus Jam 2020: SHIFT 2K20</h2>

<h3>Making-of</h3>
<br>
<p>Sorry, no detailed making-of for this entry, all I remember is that this game jam emerged after the end of js1k in 2019.
<p>The theme was "SHIFT", and I decided with my friend Damien to compete with a demake of the (anciently) popular Flash Game <a href="https://armorgames.com/play/751/shift">SHIFT</a>.
<p>It's a hommage more than a copy though, as this game was one of my favourites when it released around 2008.
<p>We spent about 20 hours re-implementing and adapting each of the 13 original levels in a small (11x11) square-tiled grid, the platform engine (moves, jumps, deaths...), the shift mechanic and the system of keys and doors.
<p>Our source file was 14kb and we managed to compress the whole thing under 2kb. A "Plus" version is also available with a few fixes and enhancements.
<p>In retrospect, we did a good job, and were proud to revive the memory of this great game, but we should have focused more on making the jumps over spikes much easier. Too many unfair deaths occurred because of these.
