<p><b>10 Years already!</b>
<br>
<p>I also remarked that in 2022, I've been Code Golfing in JS for 10 years. Let's celebrate it!
<p>I've made a list of all the micro games I had created or contributed to since 2012,<br>and took the challenge to put them all in a sigle js13kgames entry.
<p>It took me two weeks to secretly select, fix, resize, clean up and regolf a total of 28 games and 2 emulators (CHIP-8 and NES), and present them in the form of a book with the source code on the left and the playable demo on the right.
<br>The content is so dense that it required 4 "hard" passes of <a href="https://lifthrasiir.github.io/roadroller/">RoadRoller</a>, Zip, and Zopfli to make the entry fit into 13300 bytes.
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xe0YHPjsbHM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The full readme with sources and instructions for each game is available <a href="https://github.com/xem/js13k-book/tree/gh-pages">on Github</a>.
<p>The less easy part was to create dynamic iframes with sometimes astral Unicode characters in their source code, focus them, make them refreshable, etc. but I finally manage to do everything <a href="https://github.com/xem/js13k-book/blob/main/min.html">as elegantly as possible</a>.
<br><p>This entry is more than anything else an hommage to all the codegolfing friends who worked with me on each of these projects:
<br><b>Subzey, p01, aemkei, veubeke, xen_the, justecorruptio, damienallonsius, nderscore, ilesinge, sqaxomonophonen, benjamin_js, fusselwurm, parrotgeek1, keithclark, xaotic, ETHproductions, magna, killedbyapixel, jellyedwards</b>
<p>Clap clap to them!

<br><p>I had the chance to be the very first to submit this entry when the submit page opened, which gave it a lot of visibility.

<h3>My 2022 entry</h3>
<br>

<b>Before the jam</b>
<br>
<p>Before the jam started, I had 3 ideas for my next game:
<br>- A demake of Mario 64 (this one resurfaces every year, I'll do it someday)
<br>- A puzzle game inspired by Scribblenauts but where you can only spawn Emoji
<br>- A game inspired by Christopher Nolan's movie TENET, with time flowing in different directions.

<p>For the last one, I scribbled some ideas on my notepad, and even imagined that it could have been titled 13NET (which could be drawn as an ambigram) 

<p><img src="images/js13k22/0.jpg" width=500>

<br>
<p><b>Days 1 & 2: the theme</b>
<br>
<p>On August 13th, the theme dropped: "DEATH". Hm, tough one.
<p>The problem was that none of my ideas could really match this theme.<br>So I started scribbling some artwork, to seek inspiration...

<p><img src="images/js13k22/1.jpg" width=500>

<p>But nothing clicked.
<p>Then I realized that I could interpret DEATH as a game that takes place in some sort of afterlife place, like a purgatory, where time and space as we know them don't really exist.
<br>And that could be a good reason to be able to invert time and gravity.
<br>So I started storyboarding an intro scene to present this in a fun way:

<p><img src="images/js13k22/2.jpg" width=500>

<p>I showed it to some friends, they said it was fun, so I decided to get started on this game!

<p>By the way: cheers to Salvatore Previtti (author of <a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/dante">Dante</a>), Adrien Guéret (author of <a href="https://js13kgames.com/entries/terror-defense">Terror Defense</a>), and Julien Laville, who were there during all the development of my entry.<br>We brainstormed, joked and heped each other stay kind of motivated during all this month, and God knows it hasn't been easy!
