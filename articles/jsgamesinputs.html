  <h2>Some subtleties of keyboard inputs in JS games</h2>
	<h3>September 2016 - August 2021</h3>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p><h3>The WASD issue</h3>
  <p>WASD keys can be used as an alternative for arrow keys in a vast majority of keyboards worldwide.
  <br>All QWERTY and QWERTZ keyboards (and some hybrid keyboards like <a href="http://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2012/03/Russian-Keyboard-13-600x267.jpg">QWERTY/russian</a> for example) support this pattern just fine.
  <br>But there's another layout widely used too (especially in France, Belgium and Canada): AZERTY.
  <br>On this kind of keyboard, WASD becomes ZQSD.
  <br>So the idea is to teach game developpers to natively support not only WASD, but also ZQSD <b>AND</b> arrow keys!
  <br>Why support only one scheme when we can please everyone with a super light overhead?
  <p>To sum up, up arrow should be aliased with W and Z, left arrow with A and Q, right arrow with D, and down arrow by S.

  <p><h3>The JS keyboard events issue</h3>
  <p>As you can see on <a href="http://xem.github.io/miniKeyCode/complete.html">this keyboard keyCodes demo</a>, when you press a key, two events are fired by the browser: keydown and keypress.
  <br>When you release it, another event is fired: keyup.
  <br>And if you keep a key pressed for a moment, after a short pause, both keydown and keypress are fired repeatedly.
  <br>There are many problems with this default behavior:
  <ul><li>Firstly, the pause that happens after pressing a key is not good for a video game.
  <br>If you play a platform game, you don't want Mario to stay idle for a few frames before he starts moving.
  <li>Secondly, the keypress event is totally messed up.
  <br>(The keyCode returned by keyPress is wrong in most cases, and wrong differently depending on the browser you're using!)
  </ul>
  <p>So my advice is to avoid keypress events, and also to avoid relying on keydown and keyup events only to update your game's state.
  <br>Instead, the keydown and keyup events should update a global input manager, which can be queried at any moment.
  <br>

  <p><h3>The solution</h3>
  <p>Both issues above can be solved with a simple input manager:
  
  <p><b>Recommended version</b> (115b):
  <pre><code class="lang-js"><b>// Update four global variables (u,l,d,r) based on Arrow keys, WASD or ZQSD inputs. (73b)</b>
// These variables are truthy (== 1) if the corresponding key is pressed, falsy (== 0) when it's released.
u=r=d=l=0;
onkeydown=onkeyup=e=>this['lurd************************l**r************l*d***u**u'[e.which-37]]=e.type[5]</code></pre>
  <a href="https://codepen.io/xem/pen/NWjOvay?editors=1010">DEMO</a>
  
  <p><b>Tiny version</b> (74b, collisions may happen with other keys):
  
  <pre><code class="lang-js">u=l=d=r=0;
onkeydown=onkeyup=e=>this['lld*rlurdu'[e.which%32%17]]=e.type[5]</code></pre>
  <a href="https://codepen.io/xem06/pen/jOmewQL?editors=1010">DEMO</a>
  <br>
  
  <p><b>Micro version</b> (58b, arrow keys only):
  
  <pre><code class="lang-js">X=Y=0;onkeydown=e=>this["XYXY"[g=e.which-37]]-="2200"[g]-1</code></pre>
  <a href="https://codepen.io/xem/pen/bGWmrZj?editors=1010">DEMO</a>
  <br>
  
  <p><b>Ungolfed source code</b> (useful if you want to add support for other keys):
  <pre><code class="lang-js">// Keys states (false: key is released / true: key is pressed)
up = right = down = left = false;

// Keydown listener
onkeydown = (e) => {

  // Up (up / W / Z)
  if(e.keyCode == 38 || e.keyCode == 90 || e.keyCode == 87){
    up = true;
  }
  
  // Right (right / D)
  if(e.keyCode == 39 || e.keyCode == 68){
    right = true;
  }
  
  // Down (down / S)
  if(e.keyCode == 40 || e.keyCode == 83){
    down = true;
  }
  
  // Left (left / A / Q)
  if(e.keyCode == 37 || e.keyCode == 65 ||e.keyCode == 81){
    left = true;
  }
}

// Keyup listener
onkeyup = (e) => {
    
  // Up
  if(e.keyCode == 38 || e.keyCode == 90 || e.keyCode == 87){
    up = false;
  }
  
  // Right
  if(e.keyCode == 39 || e.keyCode == 68){
    right = false;
  }
  
  // Down
  if(e.keyCode == 40 || e.keyCode == 83){
    down = false;
  }
  
  // Left
  if(e.keyCode == 37 || e.keyCode == 65 || e.keyCode == 81){
    left = false;
  }
}
