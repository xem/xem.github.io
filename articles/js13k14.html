	<h2>JS13kGames 2014 </h2>
	<h3>september 2014</h3>
  <p><a href=//js13kgames.com>JS13kgames</a> is an annual code golfing competition where you can build (desktop / mobile / server-based) HTML5 games that have to fin in a 13kb zip.</p>
  <p>13kb is <a href=//twitter.com/mrspeaker/status/234946942214496256>like, infinity</a> for extreme code golfers, but we decided to give it a try anyway:</p>
  <p>I made <b>AlcheMixer</b> by myself, you can try it <a href=//js13kgames.com/entries/alchemixer>here</a></p>
  <p>I also made <b>Quintessence</b> with @subzey and @nderscore, you can try it <a href=//js13kgames.com/entries/quintessence>here</a> and read @subzey's great notes <a href=//gist.github.com/subzey/b18c482922cd17693d65>here</a>!</p>
  <p>Sadly, we didn't have time, and didn't even need, to golf the source code of those games, as they were way under the 13kb mark at the end of the month... But it was fun anyway!</p>
  <p>Hope you like them! For the record, AlcheMixer was ranked 72th in the desktop games category and Quintessence 8th in the mobile games category.</p>
  <p>Cheers, @MaximeEuziere</p>
