<h2>Golfing a 2D physics engine in JS</h2>
<br><h3>November 2025</h3>
<br><hr>
<p><b>Introduction</b>
<p>I have a long love-hate story with physics in JS.
<p>It all started in 2019, when I read <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-2583-7">this 134 pages book</a>, summarized its contents in just <a href="https://xem.github.io/articles/images/js1k19/2.png">9 pages</a>.
<p>I used that to creatz a 1.57kb lib called <a href="https://xem.github.io/codegolf/mini2Dphysics.html">Mini2DPhysics</a> and the JS1K entry <a href="https://xem.github.io/codegolf/emojysics.html">Emojysics</a>.
<p>The problem was that this book, as every book I could find at the time, didn't go beyond basic interactions between spheres and discs.
<p>Even <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-7377-7">this 599 pages book</a> released in 2022 by the same editor and some of the original authors, managed to be even more verbose in every aspect of 2D games, except one: advanced physics. And when I say "advanced physics", I'm not asking for really complex stuff, I just want to learn springs, fixed joints, hinge joints, and how to optimize speed and stability.
<p>In 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 I tried many times to learn <a href="https://xem.github.io/articles/3D-physics.html">3D physics</a> because <a href="images/2D-physics/3D.jpg">a lot of good books actually cover this topic</a>, but I haven't managed to properly implement any of them in JS (so far)... and that was quite frustrating!
<p><img src="images/2D-physics/book.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0 20px; width: 220px">It's only in October 2025, after completing a new edition of <a href="https://xem.github.io/articles/js13k25.html">JS13KGames</a>, that I typed "2D physics JS" on Google and stumbled upon the holy Grail: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1afq10l/i_created_a_tutorial_about_how_everybody_can/">this 2024 Reddit post</a> announcing a complete <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3oQ8mUF_84&list=PLSwCokO0cV86rDRBZmx-XbPIMYgzqIMZr">Youtube playlist</a> dedicated to learning 2D physics in JS. The youtube playlist made me realize that not only <a href="https://gitlab.com/Marcel.K/tutorials/-/tree/main/2D%20Physics%20Engine">the code was already available and open-source on Gitlab</a>, but <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0FL1K2ZZ5">a physical book actually released in August 2025!</a>. And since I'm so enthusiastic (and probably one of the 10 person on Eart that could possibly be interested by this book), I got it. And I'm gonna summarize it and golf the source code here. Let's go!

<p>My code will be published in public domain on <a href="https://github.com/xem/2Dphysics/tree/gh-pages">the 2DPhysics Github repo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/xem/2Dphysics/tree/gh-pages/pixelphysics_tutorial">a copy of the original Gitlab repo</a> is also there for reference and for the live demos (thanks to Github Pages).

<p><b>Chapter 1: Setting up a Canvas</b>
<p>Here we'll keep the HTML code to the absolute minimum: doctype, canvas and script tags. The canvas is called a and the 2D context x.
<p><pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;canvas id=a width=800 height=600 style="background:#eee">&lt;/canvas>
&lt;script>
  c = a.getContext("2d");
&lt;/script></code></pre>
